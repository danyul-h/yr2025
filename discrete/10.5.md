#3. yes, the petersen graph contains a subgraph homeomorphic to $k_{3,3}$ as seen above

![[Pasted image 20250520174200.png]]
#5. $k_4$ is planar, so all subgraphs of $k_5$ that are also subgraphs of $k_4$ is planar. this would happen if you delete atleast 1 vertex from $k_5$ . you can delete any one edge WLOG since it is symmetric, and its just planar as seen below.

#6. the graph has a subgraph homeomorphic to $k_{3,3}$, so it is not planar. vertices and edges shown below.

#7. yeah dood just look, its also a octahedron

p.638 #9,10,11,12,15,18

\#9a. has to be equal to or greater than 4 with this k4 situation and you can do it in 4, so like its 4.
![[Pasted image 20250615111914.png]]

\#9b. bipartite so 2
![[Pasted image 20250615112050.png]]

\#9c. bipartite again lol, so 2
![[Pasted image 20250615112136.png]]

\#9d. 
has to be 3 or greater since there is a odd cycle inside, and you can do it in 3 like so
![[Pasted image 20250615113352.png]]
\#9e. there is an even wheel, so has to be greater than or equal to 4, and can be done in 4 so 4

#10.
a. chromatic number of cycle graph of $C_{2n}$ is 2, cycle graph of $C_{2n+1}$ is 3
![[Pasted image 20250615112356.png]]
b. the wheel graph is just a the cycle graph with a vertex in the middle, so its +1 to the prior part.
chromatic number of $W_{2n+1}$ is 3 while $W_{2n}$ is 4
c. chromatic number of $S_n$ is 2 since its just a color for vertex in middle and a color that all the other vertices share, since those will be disjoint by def of star graph
![[Pasted image 20250615112523.png]]

#11.
a. in essence, is the chromatic coloring 3? if so, then the courses can be scheduled so there are no time conflicts. 
![[Pasted image 20250615114353.png]]
so, yes it is possible such that there are no time conflicts since there is a color of 3.
morning: 1,3,9,10
afternoon: 4,5
evening: 2,6,7,8
b. there is an odd cycle, so it has to be 3 or greater. so no it is not possible if the morning session is eliminated.

#15
![[Pasted image 20250615115046.png]]
so isomorphic
![[Pasted image 20250615115423.png]]
dual of g has only 1 vertex w degree 4, dual of h has 2

#18
p regions
e edges
n vertices
degree of all regions is greater than or equal to 4 since every region has at least 4 bounding edges
so the sum of all degrees is greater than or equal to 4p
the sum of all degrees is also just 2e
so 2e >= 4p
p <= e/2
by eulers formula, n+p-e=2
so p = e-n+2
so e-n+2 <= e/2
so 2e -2n + 4 <= e
so e <= 2n - 4
so done
