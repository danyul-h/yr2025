### wiens law
* tells us that objects of different temperature emit spectra that peak at different wavelengths
* hotter objects emit most of their radiation at shorter wavelengths; hence they will appear to be bluer
* colder objects emit most of their radiation at longer wavelengths; hence they will appear to be redder
* in physics: red is a relatively colder color than blue
* white light
	* all the colors combined
	* so when looking at integral, you see rectangle of white, and then rest of area under curve
	* so peak wavelength doesn't necessarily equate to color, there are other wavelengths

### reminders
* spectrum is blue (400nm) to red (750nm)
* cm = x10^-2
* nm = x10^-9

$$
\text{Wavelength of Maximum Intensity (cm)} = \frac{0.29}{T(Kelvin)}
$$

* wavelength of maximum intensity, meaning wavelength where the spectrum peaks
