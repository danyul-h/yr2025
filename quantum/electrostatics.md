* electrostatics
	* electro -> having to do with electricity *(looking at **charges**)*
	* statics -> static, as in NOT moving *(looking at **non-flowing** charge)*
* electrons(-) and protons(+) have the same size charge, just different signs
* 1 Coulumb of charge is actually a huge number of electrons / electrons have small charge
	* scientists kinda messed up bc units were first based on earlier discoveries involving circuits
* **charge is conserved** *(cannot be created or destroyed)*
	* but it can change where it is *(if something becomes positive, something else becomes negative)*
* having a net charge is having an imbalance in positives and negatives
* recall **opposites attract**
	* if is negative, the force is bringing them **towards** each other
	* if Fe is positive, the force is bringing them **away** from each other
	* or you can absolute value the numerator of Coulomb's Law and base the result on the original charges and use words
* **only electrons move**
	* so really charge only changes bc of loss/gain of electrons
# fields
* electric fields, the area of influence surrounding a charged object
	* measured as **vector quantities**
	* will be manifested by any charge
* any other **charged object in an electric field** *will* **experience a force**

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
&F = Eq& \\
\text{a charge in some known electric field:}&q& \\
\text{the known electric field:}&E& : \frac{N}{C}\\
\text{the force the charged object experiences:}&F&
\end{eqnarray} \\ \\
$$

* how to find E, the electric field?
	* idea: use imagination + coulomb's law...
	* but we dont have a second charge so lets try this...

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& \frac{kQ}{r^2} \text{, for a point charge, getting rid of q, as it's not there!} \\ \\
F_e &=& k\frac{Qq}{r^2} \\ 
&=& Eq \text{, substitute in E}\\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

* so units of E are N/C (V/m is equiv, (Volts/meter))
* if E and q are constant *(uniform electric field)*, then the force is constant, so acceleration is constant, so 1D motion equations work!
* electrons, being negatively charged, will experience a force in the **opposite direction of the electric field**
* protons will experience a force in the **same direction of the electric field**
### drawing fields
* filled with vector quantities created with test charges
	* recall add vectors head to tail
* all test charges are assumed to be positive
* lines go out of positives
* lines go in to negatives
* lines never cross!
* lines leave and enter the surface of a charge at a perpendicular angle
