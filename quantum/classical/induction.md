* inducing a current in a circuit that has no battery

### background
* circuits are driven by electric fields
* batteries create electric fields
* lets replace the batteries
	* magnetic fields can produce an electric field
	* to be specific, it is a CHANGING magnetic field that produced the current
		* a current is not registered before or after it is on, but when it is being during the transition
### magnetic flux
* flux in general is the evaluation of how a vector field passes through a particular surface area
* if the field is uniform
	* flux, is equal to the magnitude of the field strength multiplied by the area the field is passing through
$$
\Phi_B = BA
$$
* maximum flux is achieved when the field is perpendicular
* no flux is achieved when the field is parallel
* are in question is the are aof loops of wire
	* there are multiple loops
	* so multiple surfaces
	* so total area is number of loops times area
### faraday's law of induction
$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{\Delta \Phi_B}{\Delta t} = \frac{B \Delta A}{\Delta t} = \frac{Blv \Delta t}{\Delta t} = Blv
$$
* E the **induced electromotive force**, is just a fancy name for voltage
* using left and right hand rules we can predict the direction of the charges
	* left hand, electron flow
	* right hand, conventional current
