$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Electric Potential Energy}: EPE &=& \frac{kq_1 q_2}{r} \\
EPE &=& qV \\
W = q \Delta V &=& \Delta KE \\
\text{Electric Potential, Voltage} : V &=& \frac{kq}{r} = \frac{W}{q}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
* two charges exerting a force on each other will definitely start moving
	* either attract or repel
* thus there will be KINETIC ENERGY
	* energy is conserved, so it came from the ELECTRIC POTENTIAL ENERGY between the two charges
* note that as charges move, force acting on them change
	* so acceleration changes (not constant)
	* so using 1d motion wont work
	* so you need to use energy methods
	* the only exception is if a particle is in a uniform field

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
V &=& Ed \\
E &=& \frac{Voltage}{displacement} : \frac{Volts}{meters} 
\end{eqnarray}
$$

* voltage, potential difference between two points in an electric field
### capacitors
* devices used to store charge
* generally play a role in the rapid release of energy
* Farads (F) for units
* capacitances are usually small

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Capacitance} : C &=& \frac{Q:Charge}{V:Voltage} \\ \\
\text{Energy in Capacitors} : E &=& \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{1}{2}QV
\end{eqnarray}
