### magnetic fields
* lines leave/enter perpendicular to surface
* lines don't cross
* number of lines is relative to field strength
	* more lines more strength
	* more dense more strength
* lines go from north poles to south poles
* uniform field
	* would have parallel lines
### earth's magnetic field
* shields earth from many charged particles
* north geographic pole ("true north")
	* magnetic south pole
* changes constantly and can abruptly change direction
### field production
* permanent magnets made out of ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, etc.)
* "domains"
	* inside a magnet
	* align to produce a constant field
* using a current carrying wire works too
	* basis for electromagnets
* magnetic fields form loops (concentric circles) around current carrying wires
### units and symbols
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{magnetic fields, vector quanities} = B : \text{Tesla units, T} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$
* SI unit for magnetic fields is the Tesla (T)
	* Guass is another unit
* Tesla is based on the Amp
	* Amp is a unit of current, how much charge is flowing every second
	* So a 1 Tesla magnetic field would be very large
* Magnetic force still has units of Newtons
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
F_B &=& qvB sin \theta \\
F_B &=& qv \times B
\end{eqnarray}
$$
### drawing vectors
* drawing 3d on 2d plane
	* X's represent seeing the tail, arrows pointing into the plane
	* dots represent seeing the head, arrows pointing out the plane towards me
* right hand rule
	* right hand, positive
	* left hand, negative
	* thumb, direction of velocity
	* index finger, direction of magnetic field (B, for bullets like shooting gun)
	* middle finger, points in the direction of the magnetic force (F, the f word)
### providing centripetal force
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
F_B &=& F_c \\ \\
qv \times B &=& \frac{mv^2}{R} \\ \\
\frac{q}{m} &=& \frac{v}{BR}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
* at the end, we have the "charge-to-mass" ratio on the left
