* when light of high enough frequency falls upon a metal surface, electrons are emitted
	* for most metals, ultraviolet light is required

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& hf - W \\
W &:& \text{Work Function, the amount of energy the electron needs to be liberated} \\
E &:& \text{The kinetic energy the electron gets to be ejected, Joules or electron-Volts} \\
h &:& \text{Planck's Constant} \\
1eV &=& 1.6 * 10^-19J
\end{eqnarray}
$$

* work function corresponds to the amount of energy (work) needed to liberate an electron from the metal
* hf is the light
* when hf overcomes w, the work function, the remaining energy is the kinetic energy that the electron gets ejected with
