\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Wien's Law}: \lambda_{max}T &=& 0.2898*10^-2 : mK \\

* when light of high enough frequency falls upon a metal surface, electrons are emitted
	* for most metals, ultraviolet light is required

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& hf - W \\
W &:& \text{Work Function, the amount of energy the electron needs to be liberated} \\
E &:& \text{The kinetic energy the electron gets to be ejected, Joules or electron-Volts} \\
h &:& \text{Planck's Constant} \\
1eV &=& 1.6 * 10^-19J
\end{eqnarray}
$$

* work function corresponds to the amount of energy (work) needed to liberate an electron from the metal
* hf is the light
* when hf overcomes w, the work function, the remaining energy is the kinetic energy that the electron gets ejected with
* electrons get emitted with different speeds because
	* lesser wavelength, greater frequency
	* so the greater frequency is able to knock off deeper electrons that move slower
	* because these electrons have different energy levels
* photoelectrons, the electrons that get emitted
	* later become free electrons
* current eventually goes down because
	* power = energy / time
	* E = nhf, total energy for a group of photons w same frequency aka intensity
		* E stays constant, same with h
		* f is increasing, so n has to decrease to keep E constant
		* so less current
	* P = nhf / t
	* n being number of photons
