### special relativity: the postulates
1. The speed of light is constant over all inertial frames
	* Inertial Frame: Point of view of something that is not accelerating
	* this means that if Josh is on a train with a flashlight and it lights up the wall
	* and that flashlight was moving at c
	* and chaewon is watching the flashlight while the train is moving really fast
	* and he also says the flashlight was moving at c
	* so you dont have to adjust the flashlight's speed for the speed of the train
	* light doesn't follow galilean transformation
	* we can't really prove it, so its a postulate
	* we haven't disproven it
2. All inertial frames are "equivalent" / There is no such thing as a "correct" reference frame
	* Empty space is homogeneous (all points look the same)
	* Empty space is isotropic (all directions look the same)
	* So there is no right place in the universe to choose as the "starting point" or "center"
* There are others, but for our lessons these are the ones we need...
### light clocks
* since the speed of light is constant, it is useful for examining the differences in observations due to relativity/motion
	* this will blow your mind
	* things that may be happening at the same time from your perspective aren't happening at the same thing from another's perspective
* lets test effects w/ a light clock
### the situation: the loss of simultaneity
* suppose a light source is equidistant from two receivers as seen by person A
* Person B is moving to the left at speed v
* Person A will see that the light will strike the front and back of the train at the same time
* Person B will see light move at the speed c
	* the beams of light will not strike the front and back of the train at the same 
* "Sees" is not literal because light takes time to reach eyes, just take it to mean "measured" / calculated based on observations
* if the light clock is organized so the light is going up/down from person A
	* Person A sees 2h/c
	* Person B will see 2h/sqrt{c^2-v^2}
	* distance is the same, but the velocity is different
	* Person B sees the light moving on a like diagonal/triangle
### fundamental effects: time dilation
* if v is 0 no relative motion, so they match
* if h is 0 the problem doesn't really exist

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
t_A = \frac{2h}{c} \\
t_B = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}} \\
\gamma = \frac{t_B}{t_A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\
\gamma \geq 1
\end{eqnarray}
$$

* this ratio (gamma) 
* time dilation: if frame B moves at speed v relative to frame A, then $$ t_B = \gamma * t_A$$
	* there is a scaling factor
	* ambiguous use of frames of reference is bad
		* TWIN PARADOX...
		* so lets say twin A stays on Earth, and the other twin B, flies away on a spaceship and comes back
		* which twin is younger?
			* 
* this scaling factor tells us moving clocks run slower
	* the guy on the train will perceive time slower (they will AGE slower)
	* the guy outside, who is not moving will perceive time faster (they will AGE faster)

### fundamental effects: length contraction
* imagine horizontal light clock on train
* the only changes in the direction will only happen in the direction in motion
	* so horizontal here will be (l prime), (h was not prime last time because it )
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
t_B = \frac{l}{c-v} + \frac{l}{c+v} \\
t_B = \frac{2lc}{c^2-v^2} \\
t_B = \frac{2l}{c} \gamma^2 \\
t_B = \gamma * t_A \\
t_A = \frac{2l'}{c} \\
l = \frac{l'}{\gamma}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
* moving things get shorter
	* l' is the proper length
		* this gets a name because looking at object from rest is useful
### new particle
* muon
* negative charge
* same like an electron BUT HUGE
* muons live a very short amount of time
	* they last 2x10^-6 seconds before decaying, on average
* they also travel very fast
	* travel towards earth at v = 0.99998c with a starting height of 50km
	* the 50km is from our perspective
* but since d=vt and we plug in c for v and the lifetime of the muon, we get 600m, not 50km
	* so muons shouldnt be detected.
	* but they get detected all the time
	* but when we use gamma things are fine
	* from our perspective, the muon's lifespan is scaled up
	* from muon's perspective, the distance is scaled down
