* a charged particle in an electric field feels an electric force
* a moving charged particle in a magnetic field will feel a magnetic force
* a velocity selector will allow us to tune/select a particle moving at a particular speed
* so we can find only particles that werent deflected (so the forces balanced)
* so we can find the velocity via calculations
	* you can't measure it since its so fast, everything in the experiment is on such a small scale!
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
F_B &=& F_E \\
qv \times B &=& qE \\
vB &=& E \\
v &=& \frac{E}{B}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
* so velocity is the [[electrostatics|electric field]] over the [[magnetism|magnetic field]]
* its possible for the
