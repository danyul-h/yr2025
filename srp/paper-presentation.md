> notes on "Algorithmic monoculture and social welfare" by Jon Klienberg and Manish Raghavan

### the problem
* algorithmic monoculture
	* using algorithms for high-stakes screening decisions
		* such as employment or lending loans (the motivating scenarios in this paper)
	* they're more "accurate" than alternatives "case-by-case" but in a system?
	* is algorithmic monoculture susceptible to failures?
		* we know it is in biological settings
			* in agriculture, a monocultural system can be severely harmed during "unexpected shocks"--like pathogens
### findings
* even under "normal operations" quality of decisions decrease with algorithmic monoculture
	* we don't even need "unexpected shocks" to suffer from algorithmic monoculture
* so... the introduction of more accurate algorithms can still decrease social welfare because it drives the firms into a "unique equilibrium that is worse for society than the one that was present before the algorithm existed"
	* reference to "Braess's paradox" but for algorithmic decision-making
	* Braess's paradox: adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down traffic flow through it
	* note that harm is to overall performance
		* their results show that it would "be a mistake" to view the harm to specific applicants as balanced against the gains in overall accuracy
			* specific applicants, referring to those that are "locked out of the market" by the shared algorithms
### how it was done
* focus on algorithmic hiring
	* recruiters make decisions based in part on scores or recommendations
	* these scores/recs are from data-driven algorithms
* the paper proposes and analyze their own stylized model of algorithmic hiring
* created a simplified hiring process
	* 2 firms, both have their own random, private rankings (human evaluator)
	* there's also the algorithmic ranking, which is public, so this ranking is same for both firms
	* if both select from algorithmic ranking, it is randomly selected which one gets the first, and then the other gets the second hire
