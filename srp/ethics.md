cassava sciences
* biotech company
* works on experimental alzheimers drug "simufilam"
	* this drug is heavily critized
	* has ongoing "federal probes"
	* "a small oral durg that restores the normal shape and fucntion of altered filamin A (a scaffolding protein in the brain)"
	* they are now in "phase III" clinical studies to test the drug, which is a "entirely new approach to treat alzheimers"
		* "phase III studies did not meet its co-primary endpoints" so the alzheimers disease program with **simufilam is going to be completely discontinue dby the end of the second quarter of 2025** (according from may 08 2025)
	* they claim its "based on stabilizing a critical protein in the brain"
	* they were funded by the NIH
Hoau-Yan Wang
* City University of New York faculty member
* longtime Cassava collaborator
* Neuroscientist
* **accused of scientific misconduct involving 20 research papers**
* allegations 1-31
	* falsified/fabricated western blot data (evaluating levels of protein expression in cells, detecting specific proteins in a sample) and plots of clinical trial data by duplicating, cutting, and pasting, or altering plots
	* basically the above but for a bunch of different figures
* now hes a "former adviser" at cassava
* **he was unwilling/inable to provide primary research materials to the investigation**
	* investigation done by CUNY
* **he claims that much of his data was thrown away to clean the lab during COVID-19 from a request by the CCNY**
	* **evidence of this request was never found**
	* analyzed papers from 2003 through 2021
	* **also said CCNY officials destroed "at least one hard drive" when they sequestered his materials for review**
	* **he accused them of bias against them too; that they failed to follow CUNY guidelines and lacked a basic understanding of western blot analysis**
		* but 3/4 of the members routinely conduct experiments involving protein biochemistry and 2/4 routinely conduct and publish western blot experiments.
* this investigation started in response to allgeations forwarded by the 
	* Office of Research Intgegrity
		* federal entity that oversees work funded by the NIH
	* NIH funded millions to Wang
* during the investigation the CUNY didn't interview any cassava employees and denied assistance from them
* originally short sellers (people who would profit if a companys stock fell)
	* pitt from cornell medicine and bredt, former pharmaceutical executive
	* both neuroscientists
	* had an attorney file a petition to pause simufilam cilinical trials with FDA
	* the ptition early on said that the same papers in the CUNY report had image doctoring
		* image doctoring (the practice of altering images)
	* of course this image doctoring would undermine the conclusions that simufilam was effective against alzheimers
* cassava challenged short sellers motives
	* filed a defamation lawsuiot against them
* cassava investors filed their own lawsuit claiming that cassava executives misled investors in a "fraudulent scheme" regarding simufilam's prospects for success
* cassava said the relatively small phase 2 trials had "promisisng reusults"
* Matthew Schrag
	* vanderbilt univesrity neuroscientist
	* paid $18000 to produce some of the analys
### summary
* CUNY investigators recommended journals retract the Wang papers they had probed
	* multiple journals already did so
* federal authorities indicted him
	* defrauding the NIH of approximately $16 million in grants
	* department of justice statement also includes that his fraud occured between may 2015 to april 2023
	* he was in "a scheme to fabricate and falsify scientific data in grant applications made to the NIH on behalf of himself and the biopharmaceutical company"
		* 1 count of major fraud against the united states
		* 2 counts of wire fraud
		* 1 count of false statements
* US FDA also had harshly criticized his analyses of samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a clinical trial of cassavas drug
	* calls into question of the claimed efficacy
	* he never performed routine calibration of his equipment
	* he never completed verification experiments to ensure tests were "accurate, sensitive and [conducted] with appropriate precision"
	* he used improper statistical tests that "resulted in inaccurate determination of sample concentrations"
	* "inadequate source records to reconstruct the study"
* CUNY investigative committee found strong evidence of doctored images of wang's publications
	* including a 2012 paper that drove cassava's drug
		* the paper concluded simufilam reduced toxic effects of beta amyloid (a protein widely viewed to cause alzheimers after abnormal build up in the brain)
	* definiteive conclusions about the integrity of his work could not be drawn 
		* he did not provide original data from his experiemtns
	* they declared he had "long-standing and egregious misconduct in data managaement and record keeping"
* he is still at CUNY, based on their website and lack of comment

# nytimes paper
* cancer and heart disease medical advances have allowed mortality rates to fall sharply
	* these are top causes of death in the us
* but alzheimer death rates have increased
	* affects nearly 7 million americans
		* about 1 in 9 people over the age of 65
		* annual number of new cases of dementia is expeceted to double by 2050
* wang is not the only fraud and misconduct found with alzheimers research
	* eliezer masliah
		* had research shaping development for memory loss and parkinsons disease
		* 800 papers, highly influential
		* tasked by the national institute on aging to tackle alzheimers, billions in new funding
		* but he has improperly manipulated photos of brain tissue + falsified western blots
			* found true by the nih and he lost his leadership @ nia
	* berislav zlokovic
		* renowned alzheimer's expert @ university of southern california
		* apparent image manipulation in his studies
	* marc tessier-lavigne
		* former president of stanford univeristy
		* was known as a global leader in research on the brains circuitry in alzheimers\
		* resigned in 2023
		* had numerous altered images in his research
		* he didn't personally falsify data or coerce others to, but failed to correct dubious results that came to his attention
		* he he gave inadequate oversight of his lab and allowed doctored studies to build his reputation
* charles piller
	* investigative journalist for *Science*
	* had experts check credibility of 46 alzheimer researchers
	* 600 of their papers involved serious negligence, misconduct, and outright fraud
	* author of upcoming book "Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer's"
* why cheat?
	* top cassava sciences executives have made millions in salary and stock trades despite their product failing
	* people put ego and fame ahead of performing rigorous science

### alzheimer
* more than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers affected
	* emotional costs!
* leading to financial impoverishment
	* these unpaid caregivers provide nearly $350 billion in care in the us in 2023
