# [[#prokaryotic cells]] vs [[#eukaryotic cells]]
* organisms can be divided into *prokaryotes* and *eukaryotes*
* the difference is that eukaryotic cells have a true membrane-bounded nucleus
* in this nucleus holds the genetic information
* prokaryotes instead hold their genetic information in the nucleoid, a region in the cytoplasm 
* eukaryotic cells make extensive use of internal membranes
* prokaryotic cell functions occur in the cytoplasm or on the membrane
* eu- Greek for "true", "genuine"
* pro- Greek for "before"
* prokaryotic cells - unicellular
* eukaryotic cells - multicellular or unicellular
* both have...
	* dna
	* ribosomes
		* make protein
	* cytoplasm
	* cell membrane
		* controls what goes in and out cell (homeostasis)

# eukaryotic cells
* eukaryotic cells approach the [[cell-size#substance concentration|cell size substance concentration]] problem through the compartmentalization of activities
	* essentially, separate activities into their own regions in the cell
	* then high substance concentrations are only required in that region, not the whole cell
	* in eukaryotic cells, these compartments are the organelles

## - exocytosis and endocytosis
* unique processes to eukaryotic cells that allow exchange between in and out of cell
* endocytosis
	1. plasma membrane portion folds in on itself to form a vesicle
	2. vesicle pinches off, containing substances that were previously outside the cell
* exocytosis - the reverse
	1. membrane-bounded vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane
	2. the contents of the vesicle are released outside the cell

# prokaryotic cells
* prokaryotic cells can be split into [[#eubacteria]] or [[#archaebacteria]]
* most present-day bacteria are eubacteria
* archaebacteria are similar to eubacteria in cell structure, but are different in terms of molecular and biochemical distinctions

## - archaebacteria
* archae is a greek prefex meaning "ancient"
* these are modern descendants of an ancient prokaryote--one differing from the ancestors of eubacteria
* present-day archaebacteria can be subdivided into methanobacteria, halobacteria, and sulfobacteria
	* methanobacteria - obtain energy by converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into methane gas
	* halobacteria - can grow in salty environments up to 5.5M NaCl
	* sulfobacteria - obtains energy from sulfur-containg compounds
* some archaebacteria are also thermacidophiles
	* thermacidophiles - thrive in acidic hot springs with pH as low as 2 and temperatures that can exceed 100 degrees Celsius

## - Eubacteria
* includes most of the commonly encountered bacteria
