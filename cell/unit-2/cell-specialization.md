> notes from [Cells: Specialized Cell Types](https://sciencing.com/specialized-cells-definition-types-examples-13718073.html) and [MedlinePlus: Stem Cells](https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html) 

* cell specialization allows new cells to develop into a range of different tissues
* cells develop into their diverse forms from basic and general cells called [[#stem cells|stem cells]]
# stem cells
* all specialized cells come from stem cells
* stem cells make up the earliest stages of an embryo
* although immature + unspecialized...
	* they can follow a developmental "blueprint" to develop into the thousands of unique cell types in your body
* the embryonic stem cells (stem cells in an embryo) can develop into *any* tissue type
* adult stem cells can only develop into a handful of mature cell types
	* these kinds of cells can be found in bone marrow
* there are different types of "potency" to stem cells
	* totipotent - can be any adult or embryo cell
	* puripotent - can be any adult cell
	* multipotent - can be any cell in a specific lineage
### differentiation
* stem cells develop through differentiation
* cell communication is related to differentiation...
 
> **recall cell communication...**
> - reception phase; cell's special surface receptors receive a signal from the environment
> - transduction phase; the message from the cell surface is relayed to the cell's inside
> - response phase; the cell changes behavior based on the signal

> [!example]
> - body needs more red blood cells; sends a signal
> - blood stem cells receive the signal
> - stem cell transduces the msg to the nucleus
> - stem cells then respond by activating the genes that help it develop into red blood cell
> - bam! the cell differentiates into a red blood cell

### specialized tissues
* all specialized human cells belong to 4 overall categories
	* [[#epithelial]]
	* [[#connective]]
	* [[#nervous]]
	* [[#muscle]]
##### epithelial
* line the tissues, protecting the underlying tissues
* helps with absorption
* found in skin, glandular tissue
##### connective
* connects and secures tissues
* provides structural support to the body
##### nervous
* transmit information throughout the body
* composed of the central nervous system (CNS)
	* brain, spinal cord
* + peripheral nervous system
	* the nerves throughout the body
##### muscle
* the muscles, they contract a lot
