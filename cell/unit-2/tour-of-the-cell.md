>these are notes from the video "A Tour of the Cell"
# [[cell-size]]
* cells are small to make diffusion easier
* however they are not INFINITELY small because DNA + machinery of the cell has to fit inside
* thus there's a sweet spot that accommodates both of these ideas
# [[microscopy|microscopes]]
* optical microscopes use light and lenses
* electron microscopes using magnets
	* changes the path of the electrons to magnify
	* however has to be dead, as the process kills the thing your looking at
# [[cell-classes|prokaryotic vs eukaryotic]]
* prokaryotic cells, "before the egg", lack a nucleus
	* bacteria
	* achaea
	* tiny - the size of a eukaryotic cell's mitochondrion
* eukaryotic, has a nucleus
	* the live stuff, fungi, animals, plants
* all of them have...
	* nucleic material - DNA
	* cell membrane
	* cytosol
	* ribosomes
# organelles
### nucleolus
* within the nucleus
* the area inside the nucleus where the chromosomes are producing ribosomal RNA to make the ribosomes
* **this is the area where the ribosomes are assembled inside the nucleus**
	* the RNA rolls outside the cytoplasm to meet ribosomes and make proteins
	* those proteins will move back and assemble the building blocks of proteins - the ribosomes
* because there are so many proteins, it is staining that area of the nucleus, letting you see the nucleolus

### nucleus
* **holds DNA, the genetic material of the cell is inside the nucleus**
* determines the type of cell it is going to become
* thus controls the cells - decides with to make proteins and enzymes
* has pores outside for transcription and translation
	* material move out and in through these pores

### ribosomes
* small subunit on the bottom
* large subunit on the top
	* brings in transfer RNA (tRNA), linking amino acids and mRNA, building proteins
* messenger RNA (mRNA) moves through in between the two subunits\
* **functionally, builds proteins**

### vesicle
* broad term
* **a membrane bound container** can be big or small
* moves material around
* a vacuole is an example of vesicle

### rough ER
* rough endoplasmic reticulum
* a folded membrane continuous with the nucleus
* ribosomes are sitting on the outside of the membrane, thus it is *rough*
* its like a factory - **where we make the materials (protein, membrane)**
	* as mRNA comes through, the ribosomes on top of the rough er make the proteins

### golgi body
* rough er makes the proteins, they get packed in transport vesicles, and moved to the golgi apparatus
* **modify the proteins and send them on their way** - i.e. add carbohydrates
	* things come in, things get modified, then things come out
### cytoskeleton
* structure inside the cell, gives the physical structure
* embedded within the cytoplasm for organization of the cell components
* if a cell has to move around, this is involved
* bridge analogy of the cytoskeleton's components...
	* microtubules (the big pillars), made by the protein tubulin 
		* provide compressional support
	* microfilaments (the ropes tied to the pillars and bridge)
		* provide tensional support 

### smooth ER
* missing ribosomes
* **produces lipids, cholesterol, etc.**
* **important in detoxication, breaks down toxins**
	* example, as an alcoholic, the more you drink, the more smooth ER building up in the cells

### mitochondria 
* **generates energy in the form of ATP**
* has a folded membrane inside a membrane
* looks a lot like a bacteria
	* scientists think this happened through endosymbiotic theory
	* they became a part of our cell and generate energy in return for having a place to live
	* evidence below...
* they have their own DNA
	* reproduce through binary fission (you need one to create one)

### vacuole
* example of a vesicle
* **plants - large central vacuole**
	* **stores water, keeps balance with the turgor pressure**
	* the turgor pressure is the force that pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall
* **animals - smaller, and less prominent**
	* **used for endo- and exocytosis**

### cytosol
* **the dissolved material**
* fluid containing solutes
* different concentrations throughout the cell

### lysosome
* "the suicide sac"
* basically digestive enzymes inside a membrane
* can go next to another vesicle that should be broken down...
* **then the digestive enzymes of the lysosome will break down that vesicle**
* or...
* if the lysosome gets popped, the digestive enzymes will go throughout the cell and kill the cell
* **apoptosis, the process of cell suicide, is a product of lysosomes**

### centriole
* part of the centrosome
* **important in positioning the cell**
* **depending on where the centriole is, sets up where the other parts of the cell will be**
* during cell division, will migrate to either side and initiate the formation of the spindle
	* the spindle will attach to the chromsomes and pull them to either cell
* **plants dont have centrioles**
