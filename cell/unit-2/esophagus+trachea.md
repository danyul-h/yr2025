# gastrointestinal (gi) tract
* a single tube from the esophagus to the anal canal
* has 4 main layers (inner to outer below)
	1. mucosa
	2. submucosa
	3. muscularis propria
	4. serosa or adventitia
* all 4 layers have variations in different regions of the gi tract
	* the mucosa typically has the most significant changes
### mucosa
* at 20x, its layers can be seen more clearly
* layers inner to outer...
	1. epithelium
		* thick
		* lines the lumen of the esophagus
		* contains stratified squamous non-keratinized cells (appearance of flat overlapping cells)
	2. lamina propria
		* much thinner layer
		* dense irregular connective tissue
		* supports the epithelium
			* this includes through blood vessels
	1. muscularis mucosa
		* outermost layer of the mucosa
		* smooth muscles

# trachea
* a tube that connects the larynx (voice box) to the lungs
* the walls are reinforced with 10-12 horseshoe-shaped hyaline cartilage rings
	* the open ends of the rings face posteriorly (towards the back)
	* also called c rings
	* connected to each other by the trachealis muscle
* has three layers...
	1. mucosa
		* composed of respiratory epithelium,
		* lamina propria
		* and a think bundle of elastic fibers, separating from submucosa
	1. submucosa
		* elastic connective tissue, glands, lymphoid elements
	2. adventitia
		* fiber elastic connective tissue
		* c rings
		* anchors trachea to neighboring structures
