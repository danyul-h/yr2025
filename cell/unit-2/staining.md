* used to visualize the components otherwise too difficult to see under ordinary light microscope
* these things are difficult because... 
	* lack of color contrast between the object and the background
	* limited light microscope resolving power 
* also helps detect the presence / absence of cell components
* thus you can easily differentiate / identify microorganisms
* thus, **staining is one of the most important diagnostic tools in biological science**
# gram's staining
* named after the its 1844 devisor, Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram
* a staining method
* primary stain is crystal violet or methylene blue
* the microorganisms retain these stains and appear colored under microscopes 
* microorganisms stained by the method are gram positive
* those not stained are gram negative

### methodology
* based on the ability of a cell in retaining the crystal violet dye during solvent treatment
* this ability is based on the microbial cell wall
	* cell walls from gram-negative have higher lipid content than gram-positive
1. iodine is added to fix the dye, make it uneasily removed
2. treatment with the decolorizer dissolves lipid layers of gram-negatives
3. surrounding solvent dehydrates the thicker cell walls of gram-positives
* this leaves a period of time that differentiate gram negatives and positives
