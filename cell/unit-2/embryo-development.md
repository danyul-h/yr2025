> the steps of development, from a single fertilized cell to a fully grown organism
# morulation
* starts with a zygote (a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event)
* the single-celled zygote undergoes cell division 4 times, becoming a ball of 16 cells 
* ***now it is called a morula***
* the cells inside the morula then gets compacted / tightly bound together

# blastulation
> the latest stage in which you can find embryonic stem cells (blastula)
* morula's outer cells differentiate into trophoblasts
* morula's inner cells turn into embryoblasts
* during blastulation, the embryoblasts cluster to one end of the embryo
* this clustering forms an inner cell mass (ICM)
* the open cavity inside the embryo is called a blastocoel
* ***embryo is now a blastula***
* ICM differentiates into 2 types of cells
	* hypoblasts - those against the blastocoel
	* epiblast - rest of the ICM
* the amniotic cavity (an open space) forms inside the epiblast
	* this cavity will eventually contain fluid to protect the growing fetus
* the hypoblasts start to move down the trophoblast cells
	* this creates a membrane lining the blastocoel
	* thus theres a new pocket of hypoblasts
	* this is the primitive yolk sac
	* this provides nourishment to the embryo before the placenta + umbilical cord are fully formed

# gastrulation
* the two layers of cells in the center of the embryo are the bilaminar disk
	* "the two layers" refers to the hypoblasts and epiblasts touching each other
* the cells at the center of the epiblast layer migrate down and replace the hypoblast cells
	* these cells differentiate to form the endoderm layer
	* the depression left behind from the migration of the epiblast layer cells is called the primitive steak
* more epiblast cells migrate in between the top epiblasts and bottom endoderm cells
	* these middle cells become the mesoderm layer
	* then the top layer of epiblasts become ectoderm cells
* finally, these three germ layers together are called the trilaminar disk
* the embryo is in its gastrula stage now

# neurulation
* the mesoderm rearranges to form the notochord
	* notochord provides mechanical and signaling cues to the developing embryo
* the ectoderm begins to have neural folds, creating a neural groove
* then the neural folds fuse to form the neural tube
	* this will become part of the central nervous system
* now the whole trilaminar disk is called the "neurula"

# organogenesis
* develops the three germ layers to different structures of the fully formed organism
* ectoderm
	* skin, nails hair
	* brain, spinal cord, nerves
	* glands
* mesoderm
	* muscle, fat tissue
	* bones, connective tissue
	* heart, blood vessels
* endoderm
	* lining of digestive + respiratory tracts
	* lungs
	* liver, gall bladder, pancreas
