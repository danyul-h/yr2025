# light microscope
* earliest tool for studying cells ([[strands|cytology]])
* allowed identification of membrane-bounded structures
	* nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts

### - recent developments
* special optical techniques for visualizing living cells...
	* fluorescence microscopy
	* phase-contrast microscopy
	* differential interference contrast microscopy
* tissue fixation and sample preparation also help avoid artifacts or distortions

### - fluorescence microscopy
* enables researchers to detect specific proteins / molecules
* this is done by coupling the subjects to a fluorescent dye
* a limitation is that the viewer can focus on only one plane of the specimen at a time
* and, the fluorescent light is all throughout the specimen, so the image is blurred from light above and below the plane
* the confocal scanning microscope helps overcome this
	* this is a laser beam that illuminates a single plane at a time
	* this produces better resolution
	* further, this can help make a series of images to generate a 3d picture of the cell

### - phase-contrast microscopy + differential interference contrast microscopy
* makes it possible to see living cells clearly
	* this is widely their main purpose
* "enhances and amplifies slight changes in the phase of transmitted light as it passes through a structure that has a different refractive index than the surrounding medium" (???)
* most modern light microscopes are equipped with these as interchanging optical components

### - digital video microscopy
* a recent development in light microscopy
* uses video cameras and computer storage
* allows computerized image processing to enhance and analyze images

> a highly light-sensitive video camera attached to a light microscope can observe cells for extended periods of time with low levels of light
> this is called *image intensification*, which is useful alongside a florescence microscope

> *computerized image processing* involves a computer processing signals from the camera
> the computer compensates for optical flaws in the microscope and enhances contrast between object and background
> this helps see small transparent objects that are difficult to distinguish form the background

# electron microscope
* light microscope has a limit of resolution caused by the wavelength of the light used to view the sample
* even the use of uv radiation increases resolution only by a factor of 2
* the electron is a breakthrough in resolving power
* invented in Germany in 1932
* instead of lenses and optical lenses...
	* the electron microscope uses a beam of electrons
	* this beam is deflected and focused by an electromagnetic field
* the wavelength of electrons are shorter than photons
* this difference makes electron microscopes superior

### - ultramicrotome
* the samples must be exceedingly thin
* this is an instrument with a diamond knife
* sections can be cut as thin as 20 nanometers
* these help electron microscopes with the problem of electron's low penetration power 
* if the sections are thick, higher accelerating voltage can be used to increase penetration power instead
	* microscopes that do this are high-voltage electron microscopes
	* these use up to 50-100 kV (kilovolts)

### - techniques
* freeze fracturing
* freeze etching
* negative staining
* scanning electron microscopy

### scanning electron microscopy 
* provides a sense of depth to biological structures

# microtome
* a device for slicing thin sections of biological samples

# dyes
* stained and identified subcellular structures
* developed ~1850 by German industrial chemists working with coal tar derivatives
