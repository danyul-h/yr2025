#Van_Leeuwenhoek - became the first person to observe living cells--including blood cells, sperm cells, and single-celled organisms--through the use of a 300x magnifying [[microscopy|microscope]]
#Brown - examined plant cells and found the nucleus existed in every single one
#Schleiden - concluded that all plant tissues were made of cells and that embryonic plants always came from a single cell
#Schwann - discovered that Schleiden's conclusions had similar meaning for animal tissue. He also postulated the first two tenets of [[cell-theory]]
#Nageli - expanded on Brown's desc of nuclei after observing cell division, which also helped build the third tenet of [[cell-theory]].
#Virchow - concluded that cells only came from the division of other preexisting cells and helped build the third tenet of [[cell-theory]].
