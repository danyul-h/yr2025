cells come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and forms
* some cells can fit 40,000x on a thumbtack head, while others are meters long
* limiting factors of cell size are [[#surface area / volume area ratio]], [[#diffusion rate]], and [[#substance concentrations]]

# Surface Area / Volume Area Ratio
* most often this is the main constraint
* surface area is important because it boosts cell + environment interactions
* internal volume increases # of required nutrients + # of required excreted waste products
* maintaining adequate surface area / volume is difficult because...
	* the volume of a cell increases with the cell length or diameter
	* but the surface area only increases with the square
	* so the surface area increases *slower* than the volume
* ...so at some point increase in the cell size would generate too much cytoplasmic volume--which increases exchange requirements--than the membrane surface area can handle
* cells have commonly increased their surface area by inward folding and outward protrusion of the cell membrane

# Diffusion Rate

> #diffusion is the spreading of something from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration

* this refers to the rate at which molecules can move around in the cell
* important because the molecules need to reach sites of specific cellular activities
* molecules generally move through the cytoplasm or in the membrane through diffusion
* diffusion rate varies inversely with molecule size
	* smaller size = higher diffusion
* some cells use cytoplasmic streaming (aka cyclosis) to get around this...
	* this is the active movement and mixing of cytoplasmic contents

# Substance Concentrations
* cells need to maintain adequate concentrations of essential compounds and catalysts for their processes
* in a reaction, the correct reactants have to collide and bind to an enzyme
* the frequency of these reactions will increase with higher concentrations of either reactant or enzyme
* as 3 dimensions of a cell doubles, the # of the reactants and enzymes need to be eightfold to keep the appropriate concentration
