# mongols
> extra about the kushans [[silk-road#the mongols|here]]

### - nomadism
* mongols put infants on goats to acustom them to riding
* nomadism required firm decision making
	* mongols made this decision making public
	* this led to a council of reps ratifing decisions of the *khan*--their leader
	* those who disagreed could still strike out on their own

### - family structures
* menial work in camps fell to slaves
	* this included prisoners of war / refugees
* weak groups got land rights + protection from strong groups
	* weak groups provided slaves, livestock, weapons, silk, or cash
* powerful groups lived off of tribute
	* thus they spent more resources on warfare than herding to get more tribute
* leading families allianced with each other
	* acts included arranged marriages--typically made in childhood
	* this made children pawns of diplomacy and gave women power in negotitaion and management
* wives / mothers of mongol rulers took power during the transition of a ruler to a successor
	* princes and heads of ministries obeyed their commands w/o question
	* females could not succeed, so they focused on gaining the succession for a male relative
* most families believed in Buddhism or Islam; virtually all practiced traditional shamanism
	* this includes believing in a supernatural world
	* at the very least, they believed the *khan* spoke for an ultimate god
	* the *khan* also had shamas alongside him


### - conquests
* Chinggis--aka [[genghis-khan|Genghis Khan]]--became khan in 1206 with approval
* he started 2 decades of mongal aggresion
	* 1219, cowed the Tanggut rulers of northwest China
	* 1215, captured the Jin capital of Yanjing--aka Beijing today
	* 1219, went westward and invaded Khwarezm--included much of Iran
	* 1221, most of Iran was fallen, and command was omstly left to generals
* Ogodei became khan in 1227 after Chinggis died--he was his son
	* completed the destruction of Tanggut and the Jin
	* put them under mongol govenors
	* 1234, he controlled most of northern china
* Batu, Chinggis's grandson, attacked Russian territories
	* conquered Kievan Russia, Moscow, Poland, and Hungary in 5 years
* Ogodei died in 1241, suspending the war campaign
* Guyuk was the new khan, which is Chinggis's grandson
	* resumed conquests
	* 1258 marked the fall of baghdad
		* the ruler made a lot of provocations

> **mongol domains**
> Russia -> Golden Horde
> Central Asia -> Chagatai domains

* Ogodei wanted a united empire based at his capital, Karakorum
* he controlled these domains until his death
	* after his death started an internal feud
* Kubilai self declared himself khan in 1260
	* descendants of Chinggis's son Chagatai refused to accept
* this fighting destroyed Karakorum
* thus Khubilai moved his court to the old Jin capital (aka beijing)
	* 1271, he declared himself founder of the Yuan Empire
* Chagatai's descendants dominated Central Asia
	* they were also close to Turkic speaking nomads
	* this area eventually became an independent Mongol center
	* this also influenced the spread of Islam

> **yuan vs vietnam**
> the yuan destroyed the souther song dynasty in 1279
> they moved to attack dai viet (northern vietnam)
> then in 1283, invaded Champa (south vietnam)

* the mongols sufered a defeat
* so khubilai switched focus from japan to focus on the viet kingdoms
* in 1287, Tran Hung Dao brough vietnam's victory against the mongols
* plans to invade Java by sea also failed
* so did two invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281

### - soldiers
* mongols were often outnumbered
* however they had better riders and bows
	* central asian bow = wood + leather + bone
	* shot 1/3 farther than others
	* more difficult to pull
* quivers held 5 dozen arrows--albeit rarely all used
* archers shot from a distance then mongols charged close swords/lances/javelins/maces
* mongols also had flaming arorws + catapults
	* catapults were built on chinese models
	* portable, but short range and poor accuracy

# trade + travel
* nomad elites (incliuding mongol nobles) had exclusive right to wear silk
* this silk came from china but new products flowed westward (feeding luxury trade in Middle East and Europe
* travel literature also came about
	* Venetian Marco Polo mixed fantastic with factual
	* these stories would cause European ambition to find easier routes to Asia for wealth

# disease
* exchange sprea disease
* mid 13th century, marmots and rodents became infected and passed disease to dogs and ppl
* bubonic plague (aka Black Death) was the main disease involved
	* originated in Central Asia
* plague incapacitated the mongol army in the city of Kaffa in 1346
	* the plague remained there and infested rats reached Europe and Egypt by ship
* the same applied to typhus, influenza, and smallpox
* this combined into the "great pandemic" of 1347 - 1352
	* this worsened due to environmental damage the mongol brought

# mongol rivalry
* the Il-khan state
	* established by Hulegu--Chinggis's grandson
	* controlled Iran, Azerbaijan, Mesopotamia, and parts of Armenia
* the Golden Horde
	* founded by Batu--also Chinggis's grandson
	* conquered southern Russia
	* capital is north of the caspian sea
	* also called Kipchak Khanate
* both of these contained indigenous, Turkic-speaking, Muslim population

### - islam
* the adoption of islam concerned politcal rivalries
* [[#- the khanates|hulegu]] was a buddhist but had a muslim advisor
* he also gave them privileges
* before mongol attacked the middle east, some of them professed Islam

> **islamic doctrine vs. mongol law**
> muslims were against the mongol beliefs of shamanism + buddhism
> mongol law killed animals without spilling blood
> yet, muslims were forbidden to consume blood and drained animal blood

* Batu's successor and leader of the Golden Horde declared to be a muslim
	* this rose the tension between islam + mongols
	* he also claimed the land of the Caucasus--mountains between the black and caspian seas
	* these mountains were also claimed by the Il-khans
* alliances were attempted between europe and the Il-khans
	* crusaders were being pressured by muslims in the middle east (syria, palestine, lebanon)
	* non-muslim Il-khans could relieve this pressure in return of european leaders repelling the Golden Horde
	* the Il-khan court met with Pope Nicholas and Il-khan ambassadors went to western europe in the late 1200s
* in return of this alliance, the Golden Horde made an alliance with muslim Mamluks in egypt
* eventually Il-khan's ruler changed to Ghazan, who was also a muslim
	* this prevented european efforts from bearing fruit

# chagatai khanate
* a new power emerged in Central Asia during this quarrel
* the leader at the time was Timur, aka Tamerlane to europeans
* became in command of the chagatai forces and launched an attack on west eurasia
* Timur could not assume the title khan because he was an in law, but still acted like one
* he ended up dying in 1406 preapring to march to China
* his descendants--called timurids--did not hold the empire together 

# il-khans
* il-khan implemented tax farming, where tax collecting contracts were sold
* small business would fight over the contracts
* those who made the most revenue for the gov won them
* this started to lower administrative costs
* however long term this drove landowners into debt
* poor land owners -> less agricultural productivity -> less supply for the army
* thus the gov took land to grow grain on its own, and this land paid no taxes
* more army/nobles -> more demands -> more gov land -> shrunk tax base

> **ghazan's attempts at economy**
> ghazan tried to solve il-khans many economic problems but failed
> he reduced taxes, but this was simply temporary
> he tried to print more money like his predecessors, but his subjects responded negatively
> an economic depression started, and it lasted beyond the end of the il-khan state
> mongol nobles also fought over the lessening revenue, destabilizing the gov

### - the arts
* il-khans and timurids had blended iranina and chinese culture
* Timur could not reunite Iran and China
* Instead he transplanted Middle Eastern people to foster cultrural achievements of his descendants

> **Juvaini**
> this was the historian that record Chinggis Khan's deathbed speech
> he came from the city of Balkh that was destroyed by the mongols in 1221
> he switched allegiance and evenually was supported by hulegu
> he though of writing the narrative of Chinggis Khan's empire

> **Rashid al Din**
> he was Ghazan''s prime minister, and inspired by Juvaini
> he attempted the first history of the world
> he traveled widely and collaborated with administrators form other parts of the mongol dominions
> his work included conversations, and paintings that depicted both Europe's and China's culture

* the tradition of il khan historians continued under the timurids
* timur himself met the greatest historian of the age, **Ibn Khaldun**
* they exchanged philosphical and geographical viewpoints
* **Nasir al-Din Tusi** was a Shi'ite (a branch of islam) scholar
	* began mongol interest of muslim scientifc traditions
	* wrote on history, poetry, ethics, and religion
	* however his impact was in **mathematics and cosmology**
	* built upon Omar Khayyam's work
		* Omar was a poet + mathematician from the Seljuk period
		* Nasir built foundations for algebra and trigonometry
	* he interested others through observational astronomy and calendar-making
	* his students made mathematical tables and geometric models of lunar motion
		* Nicholas Copernicus, Polsih monk + astronomer, adopted this model
		* he took this and proposed the planets circled the sun
* **Ulugh Beg**, Timur's grandson, was interested in astronomy
	* he constructed a great observatory in Samarkand
	* actively compiled observational tables
		* these later got translated and used by Europeans
* **Ghiyas al-Din Jamshid al_kashi** was a mathematician
	* he employed decimal notation, allowing representation of quanitites less than 1
	* he made a precise caluculation for pi for his era

# russia

### - Golden Horde
* established by Batu, Chinggis's grandson
	* this required defeating a Russian and Kipchak (turkic people) army in 1223
* started unified, but gradually lost unity, districts became smaller khanates
	* the White Horde ruled southeastern Russia in the 15th century
	* the Crimean khanate help onto the northern shore of the Black Sea until 1783

> **golden horde's economy**
> like the il khans, they tried to introduce paper money
> this was unsuccessful
> rather than currency transactions, commerce depended more on direct exchange of goods

* decentralization began...
	* Alexander Nevskii, prince of Novgorod
	* submitted to the mongols, gaining their favor for Novogrod and Moscow
	* these places drew people northward for agricultural land away from the mongols
	* this drove Moscow into being Russia's dominant politcal center
* Russian territories regularly paid the heavy mongol taxes in silver
	* however more burden came from russian princes who shifted taxes to the peasants and away from their own lands
* The capital of Ukraine, Kiev, ceased to mint coins as Moscow took attention
