> nation building and economic trasnsformation in the americas 1800-1890

# prelude
* newly formed national govs
	* wanted rapid economic progress
	* so they sponsored railroads
	* however this led to foreign investment to pay for them
	* foreign dependence led to protests
	* native ppls lost their land too bc of railroads
* 19th century the western hemisphere had radical political and social changes
	* many colonies achieved independence
	* despite independence there was still threat to sovereignty
		* regional secessionist movements
		* civil war
* difficult questions for new nations
	* if colonies can reject submission to imperial powers -> internal regions with distinct cultures can refuse new nat govs?
	* would new govs born in revolutions be accepted?
		* especially written constitutions
		* and these constitutions... they preach freedom but deny
			* amerindians
			* slaves
			* immigrants
			* women
* in general (western hemisphere)
	* new nations tried to promote economic growth
	* but they also wanted to answer difficult political questions
# independence in latin america
### junta
* end of 18th century -> many colonies in western hemi (owned by spain n portugal)
* revolutionary docs circulated latin america
	* american declaration of independence
	* french declaration of the rights of man and the citizen
* revolutionary change tho only came from napoleons invasion of portugal n spain
	* gave a crisis of legitimacy
	* undermined colonial officials
* napolean replaced spain's king w joseph bonaparte
* but spanish were fighting rfrench domination
* thus the **Junta Central** political body was created
	* they wanted to draft first written constitution for the nation
	* most favored obedience to it
	* vocal minority (including elites) were against it
* the minority
	* they were subjects to the king (Ferdinand)
	* not the nation
	* so they wanted to create local juntas until Ferdinand regained throne
* spanish loyalists (the ones favoring junta central)
	* resisted minority
	* led to armed uprisings
* eventually movements led to overthrowing spanish colonial officials
	* then created local juntas
	* and although spanish officials regained control and punished the others
	* the repression further polarized public opinion and gave rise to a greater focus on independence
### bolivar coalitions
* caracas (capital city of modern venezuela)
	* there exists a revolutionary junta led by creoles (colonial born whites)
	* declared independence in 1811
	* new leaders were landowners who defended slavery
	* they also opposed free black n mixed-race *majority* gaining full citizenship
	* but they preached democracy
	* wanted to expand their own leaders but privileges by eliminating Spaniards (spain born) from upper levels of gov 
* this narrow agenda spurred rallying
	* loyalists made free blacks and slaves defend the spanish empire 
	* the opp. rev mvmt gave a lot of power to Simon Bolivar, the military leader
* Simon Bolivar
	* charismatic personality
	* studied the key works of the Enlightenment
	* after defeat, he adapted, and gained new allies and built coalitions
		* initially opposed abolition of slavery -> later agreed emancipation to draw in slaves n freemen
	* also employed harsh methods
	* enlisted demobilized English and French veterans of the Napoleonic Wars
		* shifted advantage towards patriots
* after defeating last spanish armies, bolivar attempted to create a broad confederation
	* thus tried to create Gran Colombia (now Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador)
	* also tried to unify Peru and Bolivia
	* but these attempts failed by 1830
### san martin
* buenos aires
	* capital city of modern argentina
	* heard french victories in spain -> created a junta

		* deflected opp of spanish loyalists by claiming loyalty to imprisoned king
* ferdinand regains the throne in 1814
	* junta leaders declare independence as "the united provinces of the rio de la plata" 
	* patriot leaders tried to control the viceroyalty of rio de la plata
		* ended up being stopped by loyalists
* in general the gov in buenos aires was unable to control regional rivals and differences
* so there was chaos n civil war
* jose de san martin
	* led a mixed force of chileans and argentines
	* recruited for the buenos aires gov and supported by them
	* ended up surrendering command of patriot forces to simon bolivar
### mexico rev vs. spain
* mexico was spains most rich n populated colony
	* rich silver mines in the world
	* and its capital was larger than any spain city
* napoleon invasion of spain
	* local viceroy overthrewn by spaniards in mexico city
	* this meant colonial authority rested on brute force
* many poor
	* crop failures
	* higher food prices
	* rising unemployment
	* anger + fear
* revolution
	* first ranchers/farmers in central mexico forced amerindians from their agricultural lands
	* urban poor n rural rose up against spanish officials
		* due to priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla urging
		* he ended up beign executed in 1811
	* although they lacked military n weapons
		* they knew for a definite who their enemies were
		* spanish
		* colonial born whites
		* ranch n mine owners who had starvation wages
	* wealthy mexicans supported spanish authorities, saw threat of the masses
	* +formidable fighting force +congress (drafted constitution)
		* rev continued under Jose Maria Morelos, making these advantages happen
		* a former student of Hidalgo
		* more adept military and political leader than Hidalgo
		* he got executed too in 1815
	* military revolt
		* Colonel Agustin de Iturbide and other local-born loyalist commanders serving Spain
		* forged alliance w revs
		* declared mexicos independence
		* created monarchial gov
		* crowned Iturbide

### brazil
* portuguese royal family in brazil
	* maintained loyalty of colonial elite
	* despite the rev happning in spanish colonies
* royal fam returned to portugal bc of a revolt
	* the king's son Pedro stayed as regent
* years of rev on brazils borders
	* led to reeval of brazil w portugal
	* many resented the portugals economic subordination to portugal
	* portuguese soldiers n bureaucrats were arrogant too
	* ppl now talk openly abt independence
* Pedro wanted to maintain his fams hold on brazil
	* aligned with separatist sentiment
	* declared brazils independence in 1822
	* so brazil gained independence as a constitutional monarchy rather than constitutional republic (what most of its neighbors were)
	* Pedro was placed as emperor
* brazilian constitution of 1824
	* provided for an elected assembly
	* granted rights to Pedro's political opp.
* Pedro's principles
	* liberal
	* protected portuguese who remained in brazil

# the problem of order
### constitutional experiments
* colonial authorities
	* arbitrary and tyrannical rule
* so rev leaders chose constituionalism
	* careful descriptions and written
	* "best protection for rights and liberties"
	* but proved unworkable
*  more ppl began to want democratic institutions n effective self-rule
	* led to armed rebellions in british canada (1837)
	* cus local elite always domianted
	* but elected assemblies had limited power
* economic development made british canada realize a gov w a nat character was required
* so there was the confederation of 1867
	* a union of canadian provinces
* british colonies understood elections
	* they were given opportunities to do so
	* but portuguese n spain colonies werent given same opportunities
	* so they had no experience w elections n representative institutions
* this led to a lot of testing political institutions in new latin american nations
* the catholic church in latin america
	* undefined role after independence
	* during colony, it was a religious monopoly
		* controlled all levels of educations, speech, etc
		* so post colony, many tried to reduce the power
* military power
	* obstacle to creating constitutional ggovs
	* wars for independnece elevated the prestige of military leaders
	* and these leaders rarely wanted to subordinate to civilian authorities
	* some citizens even saw dictatorships better than democracy bc of these military heroes of independence
### personalist leaders
* patriot leaders had mass followings
	* allowed gaining political power
	* military rep usually provided this foundation
* personalist leaders
	* relied on loyal mass followings rather than constitutions/law for governing
	* these followings allowed leaders to challenge constitutional limits
		* jose antonio paez of venezuela
		* andrew jackson of the us
	* in latin america these who gained poli power wo constitution sanction was...
		* called a **caudillo**
* paez
	* general of bolivar
	* was uneducated, poor, but strong, courageous
	* solders were extremely loyal
	* spanish is defeated
		* bolivar wants his union
		* but paez has a mass following
		* and doesnt want to follow a distant president/gov
			* other leaders shared this sentiment
		* so declared venezuelas independence
* andrew jackson
	* born from humble circumstances
	* had a military career
	* was impatient w civilian auth
	* had battle victories -> became widely known
	* was pres 2x after losing once
	* challenged constitution
		* increased pres power, lowered congress n scotus
### union of former spanish colonies
* nat govs in americas were gen weaker post indep
	* compared to the colonial govs they replaced
* spanish america tried to have federations after independence (they failed)
	* there was a viceroyalty of new spain in central america n mexico
	* but the union failed bc elites broke to form a republic instead
	* thus +disputes +civil war
* gran colombia
	* bolivars attempt at colonial unity
	* but the states declared independence
	* secession movement essentially broke it up
* regionalism in us
	* constitution made up of compromises between state vs regional interests
	* compromises were not enough to stop regional rivalries 
* slavery in us
	* divided the nation itn otwo
	* +immigration to northern states -> -poli power in south states
	* south states tried to protect slavery by expanding
		* louisiana purchase
	* lincoln checked the spread of slavery
	* south seceded from union
	* disasterous but secession failed
### foreign interventions and regional wars
* wars determined
	* nat borders
	* access to natural resources
	* control of markets

* wars also happened between nations in americas
	* by the end these states established as regional powers...
	* united states
	* brazil
	* argentina
	* chile
* mexico vs us
	* mexico encouraged americans to immigrate to texas
	* texas eventually became more americans than nexicans
	* mexican laws being broken
	* texas declares independence, later us claims it as a state
	* us vs mexico, mexico takes a harsh treaty, losing lots of land
* mexico vs europe
	* spanish invasion in 1829
	* french assault in 1838
	* french invasion in 1862
		* invasions purpose was to install a european monarch
		* started bc mexico liberals (who gained power) imposed reforms
			* limited chatolic church n military power
			* done via new constitution
		* thus civil war between conversatives n liberals in gov
		* benito juarez took presidency, defeated conservatives
		* conservatives asked france for help, thus this invasion
		* juarez ended up fleeing, but later drove the french army out
		* then executed his french replacement
### native peoples and nations
* relationships between them were shaped by diplomacy n war
	* first european colonies limited expansion to prevent wars (costly)
	* post indep, nations didnt have mediator, so expansion happened
		* thus wars w natives
		* new nations couldnt fight effectively
			* weakened by civil war n constitutional crises
			* eventually overwhelmed natives w...
				* new guns
				* larger forces
				* stronger govs
* amerindians formed alliances w british officials in canada

	* developed military
* post civil war
	* large wave of settlers
	* buffalo hunted to near extinction
	* native lands used by farmers/ranchers
* argentina n chile natives
	* similar trajectory of adapt, resist, defeat
	* og natives were resourceful
	* so gov relied on gift giving and prisoner exchange to have peace
	* but demands caused gov to crush natives w modern weapons
* chile civil war n economic depression in 1860s
	* weakened central gov
	* natives reclaimed lands
	* but later all regained by chile in 1870s
* military campaigns demonized native peoples for justification
	* chilean newspaper
		* reflects that they see it NECESSARY to "punish" natives
		* and to render them as harmless
		* and to get rid of them
		* see them as trash and disgrace to their nation
* caste war
	* mayans were forced from trad agri land
	* made poor and forced to labor
	* mexican gov had internal rebels n american invasion
	* so maya rebelled in 1847, this is the caste war

	* an independent state 
	* made of maya rebels that retreated to unoccupied territories

# the challenge of social and economic change
### abolition of slavery
* those against slavery were abolitionists 
	* argued slavery offended Christian morality
	* same w universal rights in declaration of indep

	* difficult bc plantation products were important in certain regions
	* first weakened in us bc was abolished in northern states and end of african slave trade
	* but cotton agriculture still expanded

* brazil monarchy was ended in 1889
### caribbean
* plantation economy
* received 40% of afrrican slaves shipped to new world
* tiny white minorities
* slave and free colored majorities
* slave rebellion in saint domingue scared slave owners
	* they thought that any effort of overthrowing colonial rule meant slave rebellions
	* thus little local support for abolition
		* abolition in these colonies would only really result from decisions made in europe by imperial governemnts
* slave rebellions made clear that slaves recognized the injustice
	* notably haiti, jamaica, cuba
* sugar plantation profit went down -> british labor unions pushed for abolition
	* britain ended its participation in slave trade in 1807
	* negotiated treaties w other improters of slaves to eliminate slave trade

* france abolished slavery in caribbean colonies in 1848
* slavery lasted longest in spain's colonies (cuba, puerto rico)
	* but here local forces secured abolition
		* rather than britain's diplomatic pressure
	* these had lawrger white n free color pop than britain and france colonies
		* little fear that abolition = political ascendancy of slaves
### immigration
* colonial period
	* european immigrants were a minority (western hemisphere context)
	* african slave imports outnumbered them by 2:1
* african slave trade ended in 1850s -> millions of europeans and asians immigrated to western hemisphere
	* this wave fostered rapid econ growth
	* also fostered territorial occupation
	* fast growing cities were very diverse
* majority of immigrants were european
	* initial most came from west europe
	* post 1870 most came from south and east europe

	* anti chinese riots erupted in 1870s n 1880s in west us
		* then surfaced in canada, peru, mexico, and cuba
	* same thing w japan in brazil and east indians in caribbean
* hostility to immigration increased
	* nativist political movements argued to was impossible to integrate such large numbers
	* fear n prejudice led many gov to limit immigration
	* began to distinguish immigrants as "desirable" or "undesirable"
		* europeans were favored over asians
* leaders n intellects wondered if mix of culture could sustain common citizenship
	* so assimilation occured
	* schools transmitted local cultural info into immigrants
### acculturation

* along they brought new lang, tech, customs
* they altered politics
* most immigrant groups created ethnically based organizations
* immigrants also changed w experiences in their new nations
* acculturation

* so they changed local cultures too
	* lang 
	* music
	* political n labor movements
### womens rights

	* occured bc they were excluded from international antislavery meeting for discussing women rights
	* some focused on econ indep and legal rights
	* other demanded right to vote
	* better working conditions for women working outside
* equally slow in canada and in latin america
* progress was more rapid in lower status careers

* gender relations changed
	* by the end of 19th century...
	* lots of poor women worked outside the home

			* supported distant markets
		* adopted tariff and monetary policies
			* foster economic diversification
* western henmisphere didnt rly have same income as west europe tho
	* only us, canada, and argentina matched their indiv income levels
	* all these three had open land, temperate climates, diverse resources, and influx of immigrants
* new demands from industrial rev -> mining booms (in us, mexico, bolivia, chile)
	* copper
	* zinc
	* lead
	* coal
	* tin
* mining companies were international and bullied govs and bought political favors
* govs had to depend on foreign capital
	* for the high cost of new tech
	* govs promoted railroads by
		* granting tax benefits
		* free land
		* monopoly rights to domestic n foreign investors
	* so a lot of the land were producing for foreign markets due to railroads
* new tech helped make the impossible possible
	* such as reaching a distant market (argnetina -> europe)
### development n underdevelopment

		* so they benefitted a lot
* underdevelopment -> depended on exporting raw mat n low wage industries
	* latin america
		* gained independence when world econ contracted :(
		* originally colonies with promoted prod of agri and mine exports
			* these exports faced inc comp after indep
		* suffered oversupply and low prices
		* govs resisted unions and demands for higher wages
### altered environments

* cuba cut down island forests -> expand sugar prod
* growing demand for meat -> ranches raised livestock in fragile environments
	* argentine
	* uruguay
