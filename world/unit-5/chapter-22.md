# industrial revolution
* order: Britain -> Western Europe -> United States
* uneven impact
	* widened gap between rich and power
	* rich owned factories, controlled industrial innovations, rich got richer
	* poor worked long hours, including children, in dangerous factories
		* crowded living
		* unsanitary tenements
		* struggled to buy food
	* middle class grew
		* more influence in politics n culture
		* improved material conditions
	* globally
		* industrialization facilitated imperialism, stifling industrialization of other nations
		* imperialism victims were used to boost industrialization of other nations
* population growth
	* increased demand for goods + lowered labor costs
	* europe population: 100mil, 1650 -> 266mil, 1850
	* thanks to...
		* widespread disease resistance
		* improved food supplies (new world crops)
		* income improvements (marrying @ earlier ages -> more children)
		* migration from agricultural areas to urban areas
			* ppl did this for more opportunities
			* affected employment relativity between urban n agriculture
* agricultural revolution
	* provided increased food supply
		* necessary for industrial revolution n +urban populations
	* new world crops very important
	* enclosure movement
		* rich land owners enclosed land
		* took land control away from rural poor
			* turned the poor into landless laborers
			* so poor moved to cities to seek work
		* took advantage of land solely for profit, even introduced crop rotation
* proto - industrialization
	* preceded industrial revolution
	* merchants wanted to benefit from lower-cost rural labor, away from guild dominated cities
	* this increased production, lowered labor costs, but had problems w/ quality control
	* merchant investors delivered raw materials + machinery to rural laborers instead of trained artisans from guilds
	* complex tasks were subdivided into simple procedures
		* allowed rural workers to quickly become productive
	* these rural workers were only paid for the finished work, instead of daily wages like urban artisans
		* lowered labor costs
* transportation
	* european governments financed improvements to transportation
		* +foreign trade
		* +economic exansion
	* this included expanding road networks, despite inadequate maintenance
	* private "turnpike trusts" were made to address prior neglect of roads
		* basically toll roads
	* canal buildings
* british lead
	* early lead bc of 18th century inventors
		* developed machines that x'd production
		* but still needed trad. energy
	* but then in 18th century they developed efficient steam engines
		* new source of energy for machinery
	* abundant supplies of coal + iron
	* good water transportation (during a time where land transportation was costly) due to geography
	* british engineers + machinists were most active in spreading new tech
	* other governments even tried to copy british model to compete
		* offered money for british inventors to migrate to their nations
# technological revolution
* five innovations that spurred industrialization...
	1. mass production thru division of labor
	2. new machines n mechanization
	3. increase in iron manufacturing
	4. steam engine
	5. electric telegraph
* mass production / division of labor
	* the making of many identical items by breaking the process into simple repetitive tasks
	* while workers were more productive, they had fewer skills + paid less
* mechanization
	* the use of machines to do work previously done by hand
	* increased prod. for manufacturer + lower prices for consumer
	* in textile industry...
		* innovations were simple, cheap, and easy to operate
		* john kay's "flying shuttle"
			* wheel shuttle to carry thread across loom
			* lead to series of inventions, increased prod, increase thread demand
		* the jenny invention
			* a single worker could spin multiple threads @ once, 6 early -> 80 later
			* but thread was weak/too soft, needed extra linen
		* richard arkwright "water frame"
			* larger, complex, needed water wheel for power
			* produced thread strong w/o need of linen
		* samuel crompton "mule"
			* combined jenny + water frame
			* made strong fine thread than any human could
			* @ a lower cost too
	* britain textile industry made cotton America's most valuable crop
		* lead to mechanization in americas for cotton
* iron industry
	* abraham darby
		* discovered coke, coal w impurities cooked out
		* could replace the more expensive charcoal
		* < qual than charcoal-iron, but cheaper--coal was plentiful
	* henry cord
		* removed impurities in coke-iron w puddling
			* stirring the molten iron w long rods
		* produced wrought iron--more soft + malleable than cast iron
			* cheap
	* coke-iron allowed bigger blast furnace sizes
	* more iron production, 17k tons 1740 -> 3mil tons 1844
	* cheap iron = more mass production
	* americans eli whitney (firearms) + eli terry (clocks)
		* contributed to standardized interchangeable parts in manufacturing
		* >mass prod
* steam engine
	* first to transform fossil fuel to mechanical energy
	* deep-shaft mines
		* prev threatened by flooding, pumps couldnt drain them cus they were powered by horses
		* Thomas Newcomen's practical steam engine changed that
			* crude, wasted fuel, but effective
			* but waste fuel made it expensive for others applications outside the mines
	* James Watt
		* developed separate condenser to reduce fuel waste
		* invented sun-and-planet gear to spread steam engines to other industries (flour, cotton, pottery)
	* so much coal, so much steam energy >:)
	* investors put steam engines on boats
		* robert fulton's north river, first success
		* oceangoing steam ships were more difficult to build than river steam boats
			* used too much coal, not enough space for other resources
* railroads
	* richard trevithick
		* experimented w lighter more powerful high-pressure engines
		* built an engine that used 1/3 the coal of watt's
		* created steam vehicles able to travel on roads n rails
	* railroads were cheaper, faster, n more comfortable than the horses
	* transformed the us the most
	* made 3 week trips turn into 48 hours
	* satisified need for transportation
	* stimulated iron, machinery, construction industries
* communication wires
	* battery invented in 1800
	* investors tried to apply electricity to communication
	* electric telegraph
		* england, 5-wire telegraph
		* america, morse code w dots + dashes w 1-wire telegraph
	* congress "wired" america in 1843, w telegraph lines being built
	* railroad companies allowed telegraph companies to string wires along tracks
		* in exchange for right to send telegrams station to station
		* made railroads safer n efficient
	* submarine telegraph cables were laid connected england to france
	* communication no longer limited
# early industrial revolution impact
* urban problems
	* cities grew too fast
		* most growth occured in poorest neighborhoods
		* but money went into building wealth neighborhoods
		* so then shoddy cheap houses were built for the poor to rent
	* enviromental
		* people threw trash inappropriately
		* poor kept pigs and chickens
		* rich keep horses
		* air pollution from coal
		* water contaminated by sewage + industrial runoff
	* disease
		* steamships brought cholera
	* slum life reports led to reforms
		* garbage removal
		* water + sewer systems
		* parks + schools
* deforestation
	* alr no wilderness areas in britain and west europe
		* towns, farms, etc.
	* ppl kept cutting timber
		* for ships
		* houses
		* heating
		* manufacturing
	* led to seizing land from natives
		* made it low cost for farmers
	* wood became more expensive
	* wood objects -> iron objects
*
