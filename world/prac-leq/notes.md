China’s population—about 400 million in 1900—was the largest of any country in the world and growing fast. In 1900 peasant plots averaged between 1 and 4 acres (less than 2 hectares) apiece, half as large as they had been two generations earlier. Farming methods had not changed in centuries, and landlords and tax collectors took more than half of the harvest. Most Chinese worked incessantly, survived on a diet of grain and vegetables, and spent their lives in fear of floods, bandits, and tax collectors

Above the peasantry, Chinese society was divided into many groups and strata. Landowners lived off the rents of their tenants. Officials, chosen through an elaborate examination system, enriched themselves from taxes and the government’s monopolies on salt, iron, and other products. Shanghai, China’s financial and commercial center, was famous for its wealthy foreigners and its opium addicts, prostitutes, and gangsters. Although foreign trade represented only a small part of China’s economy, contact with the outside world had a tremendous impact on Chinese politics. Young men living in the treaty ports saw no chance for advancement in the old system of examinations and official positions. Some learned foreign ideas in Christian mission schools or abroad. The contrast between the squalor in which most urban residents lived and the luxury of the foreigners’ enclaves in the treaty ports sharpened the resentment of educated Chinese.

	Instead, his government attracted thousands of opportunists whose goals were to “become officials and get rich” by taxing and plundering businesses. In the countryside tax collectors and landowners squeezed the peasants ever harder, even in times of natural disasters. What little money reached the government’s coffers went to the military. Thus for twenty years after the fall of the Qing, China remained mired in poverty, subject to corrupt officials and the whims of nature.

The Chinese government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, escaped to the mountains of Sichuan in the center of the country. 
* There Chiang built up a huge army, not to fight Japan but to prepare for a future confrontation with the Communists. 
* The army drafted over 3 million men, even though it had only a million rifles and could not provide food or clothing for all its soldiers. 
The Guomindang raised farmers’ taxes, even when famine forced farmers to eat the bark of trees. 
* Such taxes were not enough to support both a large army and the thousands of government officials and hangers-on who had fled to Sichuan. 
* To avoid taxing its wealthy supporters the government printed money, causing inflation, hoarding, and corruption. 

From his capital of Yan’an in Shaanxi province, Mao also built up his army and formed a government. 
* Unlike the Guomindang, the Communists listened to the grievances of the peasants, especially the poor, to whom they distributed land confiscated from wealthy landowners. 
* They imposed rigid discipline on their officials and soldiers and tolerated no dissent or criticism from intellectuals. 
* Though they had few weapons, the Communists obtained support and intelligence from farmers in Japanese-occupied territory. 
* They turned military reversals into propaganda victories, presenting themselves as the only group in China that was serious about fighting the Japanese.

(for ussr)
Collectivization meant consolidating small private farms into vast collectives and making the farmers work together in commonly owned fields. Each collective was expected to supply the government with a fixed amount of food and distribute what was left among its members.

Collectives were to become outdoor factories where food was manufac- tured through the techniques of mass production and the application of machinery. The purpose of this collectivization was to bring the peas- ants under government control so they never again could withhold food supplies, as they had done during the Russian civil war of 1918–1921

While Japan benefited from avoiding the heavy defense costs associated with the Cold War, China was at the center of Cold War politics. 

When Mao Zedong (maow dzuh-dong) and the communists defeated the nationalists in 1949 and established the People’s Republic of China (PRC), their main ally and source of arms was the Soviet Union. 

By 1956, however, the PRC and the Soviet Union were beginning to diverge politically, partly in reaction to the Soviet rejection of Stalinism and partly because of China’s reluctance to accept the role of subordinate. 
* Mao had his own notions of communism that focused strongly on the peasantry, which the Soviets had ignored in favor of the industrial working class. 

Mao’s Great Leap Forward in 1958 was intended to propel China into the ranks of world industrial powers by maximizing the output of small-scale, village-level industries and by instituting **mass collectivization in agriculture**. 
* These untested policies demonstrated Mao’s willingness to carry out massive economic and social experiments of his own devising in the face of criticism by the Soviets as well as by traditional economists. 
* By 1962 the revolutionary reforms had failed comprehensively, contributing to an era of famine and privation that cost 20 to 30 million deaths. 

In 1966 Mao instituted another radical program, the Cultural Revolution, that ordered the mass mobilization of Chinese youth into Red Guard units. 
* His goal was to kindle revolutionary fervor in a new generation to ward off the stagnation and bureaucratization he saw in the Soviet Union, as well as to increase his own power within the Communist Party. 
* Red Guard units criticized and purged teachers, party officials, and intellectuals for “bourgeois values.” 
* Executions, beatings, and incarcerations were widespread, leading to a half-million deaths and 3 million purged by 1971. 
* Finally, Mao admitted that attacks on individuals had gotten out of hand and intervened to reestablish order. 
* Mao’s wife Jiang Qing (jyahn ching) and radical allies dominated the last years of the Cultural Revolution, harshly restricting artistic and intellectual activity. 

The rift between the PRC and the Soviet Union allowed U.S. president Richard Nixon (served 1969–1974) to revive relations with China. 
* In 1971 the United States agreed to allow the PRC to join the United Nations and occupy China’s permanent seat on the Security Council. 
* This decision necessitated the expulsion from the U.N. of the Chinese nationalist government based on the island of Taiwan, which had previously claimed to be the only legal Chinese authority. 
* The following year, Nixon visited Beijing, initiating a new era of enhanced cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the United States.
