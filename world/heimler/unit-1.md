* started to revive in tang dynasty, and song continued the revival
    * revival = neo-confucianism, new confucianism
        * confucianism originally came from the prior dynasty, the tang
    * neo = changes 
* confucianism holds beliefs that human society is hierarchical by nature
    * there is a prescribed order to everything, someone is above while someone is below

### imperial bureaucracy
> a bureaucracy is a hierachical gov body meant to carry an emperor's will
* the imperial bureaucracy grew in scope -> rule maintance became easier
