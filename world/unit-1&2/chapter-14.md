> **Latin Europe**
> - covers 1200-1500

# intro
* ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453
* 1454, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini fears there will be no more crusades
    * 4 years later, he becomes pope
    * he says that material gain caused the lack of European unity
* during this time, Christian Europe was fighting each other more than for crusades
    * French vs. English
    * Germany presided states, but didn't control them
    * Spain and Italy could not unite due to # of kingdoms + principalities
    * Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, were against the Muslim Ottomans, but were so far away from the aforementioned western areas
* despite all this, the cities prospered thanks to...
    * splendid architecture
    * higher learning institutions
    * cultural achievements
    * military tech development
    * unified monarchies

# rural life
* western Europe = more cultivated land + [[#- agriculture|farming techniques]] + machinery
* eastern Europe = vast open land + sparse population + nobles forcing workers

### - serfs
* most western europeans were serfs
* serfs worked on large noble/church estates tilling soil
* they owed lords their harvests + services
* inefficient farming practices @ this time also reduced the value of returns they got
* they worked ~54hr weeks
* 15-30 peasant families would work for one noble family and their stone castle
    * the peasants themselves lived in 1-room thatched cottages; no luxuries
* both men and women worked, but homes were not equal
    * women were subordinate to men
    * Thomas Aquinas argued that God is found in man but not women
* rapid population growth led to this rural poverty
    * this growth came from few severe epidemics,
    * warm temperatures,
    * a revived economy

### - agriculture
* three-field system
    * new farming technique
    * split land into thirds; one left fallow, other two grew crops
    * winter crops -> wheat, rye
    * spring crops -> oats, barley, legumes
        * oats could feed horses + humans and restore nitrogen in soil
    * the third fallow field would restore its fertility
* oxen and horses would pull plows
    * oxen were less efficient but cheaper
* more population -> more agricultural settlements -> more ppl forced to farm in risky lands
    * land risks could be poor soil,
    * flooding,
    * frost,
    * drought

### black death
> the black death occurred 1347 - 1351
* this reversed the population growth
* likely originated Central Asia
* spread westward w Mongols / traders
    * via person to person,
    * and via bites of fleas infesting rat furs

> [!example]
> - mongols attacked city of kaffa on the black sea, spreading the plague
> - Genoese traders in kaffa carried the disease to italy + southern france

* 1/3 ppl died in western europe bc of black death
* symptoms
    * boils in groins + armpits (egg size)
    * black skin blotches
    * foul body odors
    * severe pain
    * death within days
* preventative actions
    * town officials closed gates to people from infected areas
    * victim possessions burned
* outcomes
    * death was around the corner, brought changes in ppl
        * some became more religious
            * self-lashing, church donations
        * others became more reckless w/ money
    * plague didn't kill livestock
        * ppl had abundant meat + leather -> improved rural welfare
* the plague periodically came back, further reducing population recovery

### - rebellion
* black death -> more working risks -> workers demaned higher pay for services
* nobles froze wages -> peasants revolted...
* Jacquerie; a revolt in France in 1358
    * peasants looted castles and killed many
* Wat Tyler
    * led a revolt in England, 1381
    * 50,000 workers invaded London
    * they called an end to serfdom
    * asked for obligations to landowners
    * murdered officials--i.e. archbishop of Canterbury
* revolts -> authorities struck with blodshed + cruelty
* eventually serfdom disappeared in western europe
    * peasants bought their freedom or ran away
    * landowners lost labor
        * switched to pasturing sheep for wool
        * others grew crops easier to maintain
    * in urban areas, employers raised wages to attract workers

### - industrial growth
* mining, metalworking, and craft mechanization all expanded in the centuries before 1500
    * primarily in Germany and east-central Europe
* mills were powered by water / wind
	* ground grain, saw logs, crush olives, operate bellows, pound linen rags for paper
	* watermills multipled faster rate than population
* water mill designs are connected to the Romans, Islamic world, and Hellenistic technologies
* however in muslim lands, animal power made more sense
	* oxen + camels were cheaper
	* plus the arid wastes provided free grazing
	* these predominated in muslim lands
* in europe, *miller* became a family name
	* grain farmers grew human + animal food
	* population growth -> increased cost of animal energy
	* they invested in wind and water mills, returning great profits because they ran on nature
	* millers often drew jealousy, having a reputation of scamming in stories
* waterpower aided in iron making expansion, powering all the technologies essential to it
* alongside iron, there were new silver, lead, and copper mines in Austria and Hungary
	* deep mining techniques developed in central Europe, spreading west
* industrial growth changed the landscape
	* new towns + outward growth
	* dams and canals changed river flows
	* quarries and mines carred the hillsides
	* streams were polluted by the growth of factories
	* deforestation accelerated
		* trees could be used for buildings, ships, tanning leather, farmland, charcoal

# urban revival
* 10th century, latin europe couldn't compete in size, wealth or comfort with islam and byzantium cities
* in the middle ages, this changed when port cities turned wealthy in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Atlantic coasts
* new churches guild halls, and residences showed commerical, cultural, and administrative dynamism
* post 1200, most urban growth was from manufacturing and trade
	* these included between cities,
	* over long distances,
	* maritime (northern italy -> mediterranean),
	* regional networks (northern europe -> mediterranean)
* venice attacked the city of Constantinople
	* this removed byzantine control of passages
	* thus venice could expand its trading colonies
* mongol expansion eliminated middlemen by opening trade routes
* Genoa, north of Italy's west coast, was equal to Venice
	* Genoese merchants established colonies in the western and eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea
* in northern europe was the Hanseatic League
	* traded a lot in the Baltic
	* merchanges ranged eastward to Novgorod in Russia,
	* and westward across the North Sea to London
* by late 13th century, Geonese galleys + Hanseatic ships converged in Flanders

### - wool
* raw wool from england was turned into a soft + smooth fine cloth
* then they would be dyed in vivid hues
* this was done by Flemish artisans
* 14th century, they became cheap to ship due to large volume of trade
	* the city of Champagne came under control of the France
	* this turned from simple markets to internation fairs,
	* becoming a place important for currency exchange
