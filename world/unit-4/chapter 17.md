> transformations in Europe, 1500-1750
# prologue
### tulips
* by 1570s introduced from the ottoman lands
* collected by Dutch
* scarce + expensive, showed sophistication + wealth + was a form of investment
* prices surged 1620s, 1630s, creating a speculative bubble
* peaked in early 1637 then crashed
* made and destroyed wealth
### expansion
* voyages initiated commercial expansion
* manufacturing grew
* commercial innovations
	* stock markets
	* insurance
	* property right protections
* cities grew relative to the country side
* wealthy grew in power relative to hereditary nobility
* had efficient armies + governments
* **global balance of power was shifting in europe's favor**
	* this was not due to a single nation, but as a collective
### culture
* beginning -> single Christian tradition dominated western europe
* end -> secular (no religious basis) political intuitions + economic interests grew
	* religious wars weakened Catholic and new Protestant churches
### negatives
* european competition (in armies, merchants, ideas) meant struggle
* death + destruction inevitable from states growing powerful
* Reformation brought widespread religious persecution + warfare
* women's fortunes were tied to their social class
* expanding economy only benefited elite (merchants, politics)
	* prices raised, so urban and rural poor struggled to survive
# culture + ideas
* challenges in beliefs was heavily influential during this era
	* religious unity broke down--more wars
	* challenged established religions and past
	* challenged traditional social and political systems
	* all this challenging encouraged others--revolutionary movements
	* brought new ideas about planet motion
	* technology like printing press + expanded literacy multiplied impact
### early Reformation
* papacy, central gov of Latin Christianity--headed by pope
	* dominated in religious + intellectual authority
	* yet lax clerical standards + corrupt
	* pope's power is funded by donations and income from church's real estate
* underway is the artistic renaissance--buildings were an example of church's wealth/power
* Pope Leo X raised church funds through **indulgences**
	* people paid money to be forgiven for their past sins
* Martin Luther challenged indulgences
	* salvation resulted from religious faith, not from "doing certain things"
* Pope Leo blocked Luther's efforts to reform from within the church
	* Luther rejected pope's authority (burning the papal bull of condemnation)
	* Luther began the Protestant Reformation
	* Luther spread that Christian belief should be based on the Bible + tradition, not the pope
	* printing press helped, and reached the Germans
* John Calvin became a Protestant Leader
	* agreed with Luther's "faith over works"
	* but thought faith alone was not enough for salvation--diff. from Luther
	* salvation was a gift from god he "predestined"
	* he reduced power of the clerical hierarchy while emphasizing simplicity in churches + personal life
	* calvinsts created regional + national synods (councils)--regulating doctrinal issues
* everything spread so well bc...
	* luther was german-born, and he found most success with german speakers
	* peasants and urban laborers could defy their masters with the adoption of a diff. faith
	* and Protestaants rejected trad. of celibate priests + nuns + advocated marriage for all adults
### counter-Reformation + politics of religion
* aka. Catholic Reformation
* catholic church started internal reforms after protestant attack
* an influential church council met, but were disrupted by...
	* political events
	* disputes of pope v. Charles V (holy roman emperor + spain king)
	* outbreak of typhus
* this council reaffirmed the supremacy of the pope + traditions by distinguishing from Catholic doctrines and "Protestant errors"
* this council was made of bishops allied w/ the pope
	* thus they did not seek to reform based on luther
* 1540, the Society of Jesus, "Jesuits", a new religious order was created
	* well educated jesuits taught and preached to fight protestants
	* gained converts through missions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas
* ppl would get persecuted or executed for having a diff. view
* wars of religion continued in west europe til 1648
* rulers of Spain + France greatly defended Catholic tradition against protestants
	* Charles V's campaign against Ottoman Empire + muslim states was slowed
	* instead armies were sent to central europe + funded by spain
	* in French Wars of Religion calvinists had military adv.
	* prince henry of navarre was calvinist leader, become king of france
	* but for national unity, Catholic faith was accepted 
	* he granted freedom to protestant with edict of nantes
	* however grandson king louis xiv revoked the edict of nantes
* originally england king henry vii defended papacy
	* but he was not given a papal annulment of his marriage (a divorce)
		* his wife didnt given him a male heir
	* so he challenged the papacy's authority over english church
	* then english archbishop ignored pope, annuled the marriage
	* and parliament made king the head of a autonomous church of england
	* henry used the controversy to strengthen his authority
		* he gave + sold land, got new navy
* english anglican church distanced from catholic, so did english puritans (calvinists) but even more 
### local religion
* religion-enforcing institutions were strongest in urban/weak/small towns
* here religion blended established churches, pre-christian beliefs, magic, spells, ancient curing practices
* local religion often receded with increasing strength of national religion
* **witch-hunts** by protestants + catholics are linked to the local belief in magic
	* so deadly bc educated + powerful believed in the devil's power to affect society
* prevailing natural world belief traditions
	1. pre-christian, passed orally, believed in magic + spirits
	2. taught biblically, grew with publishings, christian miracles/saints/devils coincided with magic/sorcery/witchcraft
	* widely assumed that ppl possed powers from occult knowledge or devil contract
	* benign -> heal sick, flourish love, good fortune, punish enemies, solve disputes
	* malevolent -> cause infertility, illness, death, crop failure, epidemics, droughts
* witch-hunts continued to til the last decades of 17th century
* still belief of supernatural causes prevailed--ex: God punishments
* 100,000 ppl tried, 60,000 executed in witchhunts, 3/4 women
* rulers/authorities actively participated
* both accusers + accused believed in the magic
	* torture brought out confessions
* execution numbers were not even throughout--example of practice differences

### scientific revolution
* intellectual environment was as unstable as the religion + politics
* early, it was believed earth was the center of the universe
* begin 16th century, there was emphasis on experimentation, observation, math calculations
* most influential intellectuals were Christians seeking to use science to reinforce religious beliefs
* Nicholas Copernicus, proposed the sun was the center of the universe
* Danish Tycho Brahe + Johannes Kepler, improved Copernicus's model--showing elliptical orbits instead of circular
* Galileo Galilei, built a telescope to confirm speculations through observations
* heliocentric universe was resisted bc it challenged biblical authority
	* Inquisition, the heresy combat of the catholic church, confronted the theory
	* Galileo argued that the bible should be reinterpreted to match the scientific findings
	* Galileo was forced to reject his own findings after being confined + tortured
	* catholic church was an opp. of new science
* still printed books spread the new wideas
* Rene Descartes, furthered physics + calculus w/ algebra + geometry
* Robert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, demonstrated air was necessary for sound transmission--he advocated for experiments
* Royal Society, promotes science and experiments--motto is "Nullius in Verba"/"Nothing in Words"
* Isaac Newton, built on Boyle + Descartes, developed law of gravity + calculus
* world of ideas was changed forever
	* if biblical ideas abt the natural world failed against science, what else would?
	* so ppl questioned traditions/superstitions more
	* catholic church also instilled a lot of fear that some would delay their findings
### early enlightenment
* based on open and critical examination of human society
* applying scientific method to analyze economics, politics, social organization
	* thus after there would be a devised best policy
* faced opp. from political + religious establishments
* intellects became secular bc of the resistance
* bigotry came from the brutal treatment in witch-hunting
* enlightenment was more of a frame of mind than a movement
* despite churches opp. enlightenment, european monarchs selectively endorsed new ideas
	* anticlerical intellects could be useful alliess against church power and wealth
	* also the enlightened asking for policy changes could justify royal expansion 
* by 1750, controversial ideas thrived in spite of opp. bc of technology, divisions, and growing literacy
# social + economy
* society was dominated by a small number of noble families
	* they had privileged access to high offices in the church, gov, military
	* most times they were exempted from taxes too
* below the nobles were a larger class of prosperous commoners
	* clergy, bureaucrats, professionals, military officers, merchants. artisans, rural landowners
* however vast majority of europe were very poor
	* these r the laborers, journeymen, apprentices
	* struggled for daily bread
	* faced unemployment + privation (essentials were scarce)
	* had to beg or do crime
* women were still subordinate to men
* social change occurred bc of economy stimulated by long distance trade and access to gold/silver
### bourgeoisie
* europe cities grew rapidly
	* 1500, paris is only city w/ >100,000 inhabitants
	* 1700, addition of 12 more cities
* trade, manufacturing, and finance sparked urban wealth
	* the class that dominated these activities were called the bourgeoisie
	* meaning burghers, town dwellers
	* they worked long, put profit back into their businesses, but could be comfortable if they wanted
* the dutch were examples of these ppl--estimated that they did more than half of all oceangoing commercial shipping in the world in 17th century
* dutch = netherlands = holland = amsterdam
	* amsterdam was  hollands largest city
	* europe's major port too!
* they also introduced the fluit/'flyboat"
	* this was a new inexpensive ship design
	* required only a small crew, but had large capacity
* the East Indiaman was another merchant boat made
	* heavily armed
	* helped dutch establish supremacy in indian ocean
* amsterdam was also a financial center
	* banks had rep for security
	* wealthy indiv.s and gov.s from west europe would entrust them with their money
	* these banks invested these funds into real estate
	* or they loaned them to factory owners / gov
	* also provided capital for commercial ops. overseas
### joint-stock company
* these were for indiv.s seeking higher returns than the ones from banks
* ppl bought/sold shares from these companies
* forerunners of modern corporation
* this was done at markets called stock exchanges
	* innovated by italy, transferred to north west europe in 16th century
* amsterdam was europe's greatest stock market in 17th & 18th centuries
* dutch helped w/ these by creating monopoly commercial enterprises
	* these were granted monopolies for trade w the easat + west indies
	* these companies then sold shares to indiv.s to raise sums for overseas enterprises
	* the risk + profit was spread throughout the investors
* france and england soon did the same
* in this era insurance companies were also developed to insure long distance voyages against loss
	* by 1700 it became standard to have insurance 
* govs, including the dutch, invested in infrastructure to promote trade
	* canals speed transport, lower costs, drained lowlands for farming
	* systems of locks to raise barges up over hills
	* french specifically made a 150mi/240km canal to connect atlantic <-> mediterranean
* english grew to compete w/ dutch
	* double merchant fleet 1660 -> 1700, foreign trade rose 50%
	* state rev. from customs duties 3x, supporting navy growth
		* naavy broke dutch dominance in wars
* bourgeoisie in england + france
	* rose social status w/ wealth
	* retired from their businesses, bought country estates
	* thus became members of the gentry
		* this is the class of the landholding families below the aristocracy
	* increased land w/ loans to brokies + nobles
	* searched for aristocratic husbands for daughters
		* nobles were attracted for the dowries from the bougie
### peasants and laborers
* serfdom declined after black death
* western
	* competition for work lowered wages
	* usefulnes of serfdom was reduced
* brief expansion of african slavery in sourthern europe in 1500 
	* but all shipped to americas after 1600
* eastern
	* forced labor endured
	* large scale landowners in russia had profits from bound labor of serfs making grains
* legal freedom made life safer n secure
* agriculture efficiency did not improve much
	* bad years brought famine
	* good ones only had small surpluses
	* thus material conditions may actually be worse in 1500-1750 than 1300
* a little ice age fell avg temp
	* century of relatively cool climate in 1590s
	* notable affects on agriculture
* americas high yield new crops helped poor rural europe not starve
* potatoes + maize became staples, once being only famine foods
* northeastern, central europe -> potatoes
* italy -> maize
* the lands were major exporters of wheat, but their laborers themselves could not afford to eat it
* other jobs included minerss, lumber jacks, and charcoal makers
	* expanding iron industry
	* but wood fuel caused deforestation
	* wood price became high, so smelters switched to coal
	* coal mining thus increased 12x from 1550 - 1700
* europe states feared deforestation, seeing it as economic threats
* giant gap between rich and poor provoked rebellions
	* also hate for merchants, as they had high prices
	* rebellions increased as rural conditions worsened
		* typically food shortage / tax increase
### women + family
* women's status was tied to their husbands
* unmarried women were tied to their fathers
* some widows independently controlled assets such as properties
* a woman could inherit a throne in the absence of a male heir in some nations
* although women still ranked below men...
* class and wealth defined women's pos more than their sex
	* wife/daughter of a rich man had a better life than a poor man
* single women might try to take positions of responsibility
* privileged families were likely to arrange marriages, not the poor
	* royal / noble families arranged for family interests
	* bougie were less likely to arrange but still wanted to advance their own interests
* europeans married later than people in other cultural regions
	* sons put it off until they could live on their own
	* young women had to work to help their parents
		* typically as domestic servants
* essentially marriage happened in a guys late twenties, with a bride few years younger
	* other parts of the world it was in the teens
	* this held down birthrate + enabled independence
* 1/10 of urban births were to unmarried women
	* these babies would get left on the doorstep of churches or rich households
	* theyd get raised as orphans
	* but the neglected perished
* young women newly arrived in growing cities from the countryside were often put into brothels or begging 

# politcal innovations
* politcal leadership: spain -> netherlands -> england -> france
* early on, rulers admired centralized powers
* later, enlightenment made checks and balances favorable
### state development
* a lot of political diversity was present
* city-states abounded--independently or as federations
	* holy roman empire was one, a loose federation of german states
* an integrated european empire was blocked from dynastic ambitions and other circumstances
* habsburg was a powerful family of austria
	* provided made emperors for the holy roman empire
* Charles V (Charles I of Spain) sought to turn back advance of Islam on europe's mediterranean flank
	* also wanted to contend with france for dominance of italy
	* beginning of reformation, redirected resources for counter-reformation
	* these religious wars drained his treasury
	* thus he was eventually limited in what he could do
	* religious diversity eventually bested him, and put off german political unification 
	* retired to a monastery in 1556
* his son Philip II inherited his things, including debt
	* he still continued to have expensive wars, and led to 4 bankruptcies in iberian ports
	* he also depended on the spanish nobility for forces due to his ambitions
	* he lost connection of spain and england after his english wife died w/ no heir and was replaced
	* had victories against the ottomans--dominating italian peninsula
	* but did not defeat protestants in netherlands
	* thus spain was not able to maintain domination of atlantic with challenges from dutch, english, and french
* spain was isolated from the debates + innovations of the era
	* inflation made their products uncompetitive
	* thus they lost the pace of technological innovation
	* Counter-Reformation sent away foreign publications
	* also ordered spanish students leave foreign universities
	* thus intellectuals could not learn elsewhere from others 
### english monarchy
* king charles I of england ruled for 11 yrs w/o summoning parliament to evade checks on his power
	* raised funds through loans from wealthy subjects
	* also applied already existing tax laws more broadly
	* could've made new taxes, but that required parliament consent
	* a rebellion forced him to summon parliament for taxes to pay for an army
	* parliament didn't want to be ignored, so sought guarantees before authorizing the new taxes
	* king refused and tried to arrest the critics from parliament 
	* thus english civil war started
* religious division also fueld civil war
	* charles was a nominal protestant
	* yet married to a catholic
	* yet a catholic tried to blow up his father
	* protestants feared a reestablishment of the catholic church and repression
	* so parliament and king disagreed
* english civil war
	* ended with king charles I execution in 1649
	* checked the growth of royal absolutism
	* ensured england would be a constitutional monarchy
* oliver cromwell replaced the monarchy w/ a republic
	* but he also didnt share the power
* Charles II came, then James II
	* James II didnt respect parliament rights either
	* and he baptized his heir as a romn catholic
	* so he was exiled and forced from the throne
	* this happened thanks to the bloodless glorious revolution of 1688
* James was replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange
* the bill of rights of 1689 formalized a new constitutional order
	* required the king to call on parliament frequently to consent to changes in laws or raise an army in peacetime 

### french monarchy
* estates general waas like the english parliament
	* represented the trad. rights of the clergy, nmobility, and towns
	* asserted their rights during the 16th century french wars of religion
		* this was when the monarchy was weak
* they werent called into session after the war
	* instead monarches put off financial crises w/ efficient tax collection
	* also sold appointments to high gov. offices
	* they also borrowed
		* however french debt levels challenged trad. fiscal practices
* absolutism described the power of french monarchs during them, but louis xiv was the most powerful of them and negotiated his politices with authorities
* louis xiv moved his court to a palace at versaillies
	* this could house 10k ppl
	* became a symbol of royal grandeur + power over the nobility
	* allowed more intense interactions with the monarch in cycle of rituals n ceremonies

### warfare n diplomacy
* beyond civil wars, states fought international conflicts to extend colonial empires
* so major european nations were almost always at war
* +geographic scope = +army = +expenses
	* yet no one could cut back for competition in colonial wealth
* Thirty Years' War
	* worst international conflict
	* caused long lasting depopulation n economic decline of holy roman empire
* however the wars led to...
	* improved organization, skill, n weaponry of european armed forces
	* training n battlefield control was improved through increased drilling
		* also introduced new signaling techniques
	* fortifications expanded
	* thus they steadily became the most powerful in the world
	* number of armed forces also increased
* but still there was relience on nobility
	* rather than skill, patronage was basis for promotion
* england was safe from the threat of direct invasion, so it did not maintain a standing army
	* it depended on the navy instead
	* it rose as a sea power under king henry viii
		* promoted a domestic iron industry to supply cannon
	* also copied better dutch ship designs
* despite france being the most powerful, there was a balance of power with coalitions of other states
### paying the piper
* heavy military cost + expanding bureaucracies + infrastructure improvements + extravagance of monarchs
	* difficult to pay
	* gov. collected taxes indirectly w/ tax farmers
		* private indiv.s that paid a flat rate to the gov (usually <50% of the estimated tax obligation) for the right to collect the tax
	* this allowed them to avoid creating new expensive bureaucracies
	* however this also led to corruption and limited rev. growth
* it was difficult to grow rev. when nobility n clergy were exempted from taxes
	* remember these ppl controlled most of europes wealth
* in france and spain
	* this led to implementation of regressive new taxes on peasants n commerce
* gov. saw that elite resisted taxes but loved stocks and gov. bonds
* the french gov eventually had John Law issue paper money to be exchanged at value for silver/gold coins
	* this waas bc the silver n gold coinage value was debased
	* this did work, and even preferred over coin
* John law also had a monopoly company to develop french colonial territories along the mississippi river
	* another thing that worked, had a bubble
* money was just being printed and printed--it was easier to do that than collect taxes!
* however fear in paper money led to the paper wealth disappearing in matters of days in 1720
	* law ran and french gov had to face the crisis once more
* south sea company of england had exclusive rights to trade w/ spanish colonies
	* wasn't actually profitable, but investors believed it was
	* helpd gov. turn debt into shares
	* but ofc it crashed eventually after reaching 1050 euros
* eventually the govs just had to impose taxes
* the netherlands rose in economic power differently
	* originally governed by spain, and king philip ii imposed heavy taxes
	* dutch revolted in 1566 and in 1572
	* dutch fought and trained hard
	* spain could not bear military costs, and accepted a truce, giving autonomy of netherlands in 1609
	* in 1648, independence, became final
	* the long war helped netherlands emerge as a great trading nation rather than ruin
