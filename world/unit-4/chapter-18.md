> the diversity of american colonial societies, 1530-1770
# prologue
* shulush homa--aka "red shoes"
* 18th century Choctaw leader
* befriended the french
	* protected them + traded deerskin
	* received guns + gifts
* england v. france war, cut off gun supply
* his tribe was unhappy, so he made a deal w/ england for guns
	* france gets mad bc of deal
	* bounty put on red shoes
		* sparked civil war in choctaw
* by the end, both french + choctaw suffered
* 3 themes from this story...
	1. despite european threatened amerindians, they also adapted new technologies that helped amerindians thrive
	2. technologies, resources, culture transferred n transformed in new n old world
	3. the cultures that arose changed based on their connections to slave trade n society
# columbian exchange
> the transfer of animals, people, diseases between the New and Old Worlds 
### demographic changes
* new world's long isolation -> lack of disease immunity -> high amerindian death rates during early colonial period empidemics
* smallpox, deadliest early epidemic
	* arrived in caribbean in 1518
	* 50% of amerindians in mexico n central america died 
* measles (1530s), then diphtheria, typhus, influenza, and pulmonary plague
* native peoples' ability to resist european settlement was undermined by these diseases
### transfer of plants n animals
* settlers brought...
	* wheat, olives, grapes and garden vegetables (sourther european staples)
	* rice, bananas, coconuts, breadfruit, sugar (african n asian)
	* livestock
		* few natural preds. in new world, so they x'd rapidly
		* also brought (destructive) environmental change, as they grazed grasses (>erosion)
* livestock gave natives +meat +hides, despite damaging their loved land
	* natives put livestock to their advantage, turning to professions based on them (herders/weavers)
	* horse had most impact, +hunting effic. +military capacity. 
* natives remained loyal to their trad. but added citrus, melons, sugar, n salad greens
* natives gave
	* maize, potatoes, manioc
	* the growth of world pop after 1700 resulted from the spread of these crops
	* these provided more calories per acre than most old world staples
	* squash, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chilies, and chocolate too
	* dyes, medicine, cotton, tobacco 
# spanish america n brazil
* <100 yrs after Columbus 1st voyage to the western hemisphere, the Spanish empire owned most of the Caribbean + from north Mexico to modern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay
	* shows rapid expansion n settlement
* Portuguese settlement slower, but occupied most of Brazilian coast n South America interior by end of 16th century
* Span n portugal built colonies based on their homelands customs n institutions
	* imposed foreign ideas onto natives
* aztec n inka natives protected trad. w/ marriage/alliances spanish settlers
	* thus natives still had influence in colony development
	* also used colony courts to defend claims to land
* natives were military allies n laborers
	* their culture still survived beneath the imposed culture--survived the conquest
	* latin american culture development reflected this
* then african slave trade was added--third cultural stream to colonial latin america
### state
* conquistadors had a lot of indiv. power
	* royals wanted to change this--have royals control both settlers n natives
	* but geography n technology prevented this
	* distant colonies could not b controlled--too long of trips
* thus high ranking officials in the colonies had broad power
	* but also faced obstacles bc of how vast the land was
* before 17th century, most colony officials were spanish-born, then most were local-born
* portugal had lack of motivation in brazil, focused on asia n africa, so development was slow
* spanish n portuguese colonial gov. > france n great britain colonial gov
	* more uniform, more extensive but more costly
* these govs were paid by...
	* spanish america -> silver n gold mines
	* brazil -> sugar plantations
	* but also taxed heavily by homeland (slowing growth)
### church
* catholic church introduced christian belief, european lang, culture (spanish america, brazil)
	* converted amerindians
	* introduced printing press
	* founded education institutes
	* met spirtual needs of european settlers
* spain n portugal justified american conquest w/ an "obligation" to convert natives to christianity
* despite many conversions, small num of missionaries, thus lack of quality of indoctrination
* tactic...
	* convert amerindian elites -> rest will follow along
	* tried to make native leite priests
* but many converts were secretly observing old beliefs n rituals
	* thus there was a trial n punishment of aztec nobles for heresy
	* also torturing of many mayans
	* led to a movement of pushing back christian evangelical effort--church also stopped their recruitement of native priests
		* catholic church then became interested in destroying native beliefs
* bartolome de las casas
	* most influential defender of amerindians in early colonial period
	* was a settler--he was living off the forced labor of the natives
		* became moved by the deaths of natives n misdeeds of spanish
	* became a priest n first bishop, and was advocating for natives peoples
		* achieved outlawing enslavement of amerindians and limited forced labor
* americas were so linguistically diverse n geographically dispersed
	* bested catholic christians' desire to spread belief without alteration
	* thus a unique amerindian christainity was made, 
		* blending native trad. n european christian
		* to setters n catholic clergy, this mix was seen as devil work / amerindian inferiorty
* epidemic n conversion resistance...
	* led to catholic church redirecting to growing colonial cities (w/ >european ppl)
	* thus universities n secondary schools were founded
	* stimulated urban intellectual life
	* slowly church became richest in spanish colonies
		* controlled ranches, plantations, vineyards, and was society's banker
### colonial economies
* silver mines (peru n mexico)
* sugar planations (brazil)
* ^ dominated economic development of colonial latin america
* this *mineral* wealth developed european capitalism n expanded europes trade w/ asia
	* grew colonial cities
	* concentrated resources/capital in one area
	* made neighboring rural areas foces on livestock/agriculture
* silver > gold
	* potosi, alto peru--single richest silver depo in americas
* silver extraction
	* mined silver -> smelt (crushed ore packed w/ charcoal n fired in a furnace) -> deforestation
	* deforestation bad so instead...
	* chemical extraction via mixing mercury w/ silver ore
		* still effected environment--mercury is poison--n sickened amerindians
* spanish authorities divided amerindians among settlers--forcing labor or goods
	* this was called encomienda
	* epidemics + mistreatment -> -amerindian ppl -> new laws eliminating encomienda
* silver changed things
	* mexico -> relied on wage laborers (not many surviving natives)
	* peru -> imposed mita system on amerindians (more surviving natives)
		* less population, more mita obligations
			* harsh treatment, so natives abandoned trad. and moved to spanish mines/farms as *paid* laborers
			* signs of assimilation of natives into settler society
* portuguese
	* alr developed sugar plantations w/ african slave labor (atlantic islands)
	* ^ early experience allowed quick transfer to brazil
	* at first enslaved ameridians from war/seizement
	* epidemics -> slave raiders actively attacked amerindians for labor
* african slaves became more relied upon than amerindian slaves
	* they were more productive n resistant to disease
	* profits increase -> imports of african slaves increased (to more than settlers coming in)
* the mining centers of mexico n peru eventually had global econ. influence
	* +european money -> promoted commercial expansion -> industrialization
	* +silver in asia -> more middle eastern middlemen action
	* +colony urban pop. growth despite inhospitable altitude
	* centers would rely on regional resources i.e...
		* chilean wheat
		* argentine livestock
		* ecuadorian tetiles
* sugar plantations of brazil had similar role but for south atlantic region
	* brazil exchanges sugar, tobacco, n slaves
	* in return for erba (paraguayan tea) hides, livestock, and silver
	* portugal was also open to trade w british
		* brazil thus bbecame a conduit for illegal trade between spanish colonis n europe
### society in colonial latin america
* few spain nobles came to new world--besides viceroys
* but lesser nobles n professionals were well presented
* criminals, beggars, n prostitutes also made it to colonies
* spanish settlers were the minority w/ amerindians, africans, creoles (white american-born by europe parents), n mixed ppl  
* social n political class
	* conquistadors wanted a hereditary system like european nobility
	* but they lost control to do this
	* evntually colonial officials, clergy, and rich merchants dominated the social hierarchy
	* tensions between spaniards n creoles, but most families included both groups
	* europeans -> clergy, gov
	* creoles -> agriculture, mining
* native class
	* pre conquests, had complex cultural n linguistic groups
	* diversity was erased w/ relocation, racial labeling, n labor demands
	* amerindians elites struggled to survive--new politic n economic envir.
		* tried kinship w colonists
		* still, links weakened w/ time
	* others were intermediaries between colony n natives
		* collected taxes
		* recruited laborerss
		* provided military aid
	* in general tho, social pos. diminished w/ time
	* native commoners lost the most
		* forced tribute n labor, loss of land
	* survivors had to adapt or resist using settler tools (ie colonial courts)
### slaves
* many blacks conquested spanish america as slaves
	* many gained freedom during it
	* juan valiente was one, escaping his master in mexico then being an early settler or chile
* settlers discriminated against african slaves bc of diverse culture--signs of differences
	* most came from west central africa--esp. kongo
		* here pre exposed to iberian (spain, portugal) culture
	* despite being skilled artisans, were forced into labor jobs w/ bad conditions
* barriers between slaves divided them n made resistance more difficult
* slave resistance was...
	* sabotage
	* malingering
	* running away
		* running away was typically effective for some years
		* called quilombos (brazil) n palenques (spanish)
	* rebellion
		* colonial auth. always regained control despite rebellions
* typically a gender imbalance on plantations
	* planters preferred male slaves
	* thus there was a obstacle to trad. marriage n family patterns of africa n erope
* brazil -> smaller pop than spanish america -> depned african slave eraliest
	* africans were largest racial group in brazil
	* thus brazil was most influenced by african culture, more than amerindians
* manumissions--the granting of freedom to slaves                                     
* courts also protected slaves from abuse n against family separation
* free black pop. grew rapidly
	* slave women received more manumissions than men
	* any children born after manumissions were legally free
	* thus mixed-descent pop.becaeme majoriy in many regions
* mestizos, the mixed offspring of europeans and amerindians
	* few european fathers acknowledged them
	* occupied a mid. pos. in colon
	* dominated artisan trade n small scale farming
* mulattos, mixed europeans n africans
	* similar to mestizos
* castas, mix of amerindians n africans
