> these are notes *separate* from the textbook, but from a provided Crash Course video
* overland route where merchants carried trade
* did not begin trade, but dramatically expanded its scope
* should not be thought as a road, but a network of trade routes
	* this included sea routes
* impacted [[#economy]], [[#ideas]], and [[#disease]]
* its growth made the nomad people far more important in world history 
# disease
* measles, smallpox, and the bubonic plague traveled from the east to the west
* black death
	* half of all Europeans died in 4 years--this is the largest population decimation in human history
* the silk road played a role in the spread of disease by creating this interconnection 

# ideas
* the Silk Road was the primary route for the spread of Buddhism
* Buddhism was beginning to dwindle in India, but contact with other cultures and traditions, it became to flourish
* many merchants began supporting monasteries--buildings occupied by monks
	* this turned them into convenient weight stations for caravans
	* merchants believed that this support was giving them insurance for a good afterlife
	* monks would pray for the success of trade missions and the health of their patrons
	* note silk was also one of the central materials in rituals

# economy
* traders would very rarely traverse the whole road
	* they would instead move back and forth between towns and sell to other traders
* eventually nomads were being outdone by professional merchants
* however the *cities* nomads built became important
	* they continued to grow because trade was by caravan
	* caravans had to stop frequently for resources--food, water
	* one example is *palmyra*--a town that became wealthy due to it having to be passed to bring incense and silk to Rome
* merchants grew with the Silk Road and got political clout
* note that as silk market grew, there was more people dedicating their lives *making* that silk rather than anything else

> **goods being sold**
> - silk, which was only produced in China
> 	- its production was heavily guarded + secret due to its huge impact on China's wealth

> - china: silver, jade, iron
> - mediterranean: olive, olive oil, wine 
> - india: fine cotton textiles
> - east africa: ivory
> - arabia: incense, spices, tortoise shells

# the mongols
* Central Asia wasn't great for agriculture and difficult to conquer
* the mongols however were a group of nomads in Central Asia
* they were good at herding, moving stuff from point A to point B, and thus good traders
* all their travel made them more resistant to diseases

> **the yuezhi**
> - these were a group of such nomad
> - they were embarrassed by a rival group: Xiongnu
> - so they migrated to Bactria and started the **Kushan Empire**
> 	- this empire is in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan
> 	- they became a hub for silk road trade in ~100-300
