> **Networks of Communication and Exchange**
> - this chapter examines the social systems and historical impact of exchange networks that developed between 300 BCE and 1100 CE in Europe, Asia, and Africa
> - these networks include the [[#silk road]] and [[#indian ocean maritime system]]
# chronology
* silk road
	1. 247 BCE: Parthian rule begin
	2. 128 BCE: [[#- iranians and chinese|General Zhang Jian]] reaches Ferghana
	3. 100 BCE-300 CE: [[silk-road#the mongols|Kushans]] rule northern Afghanistan and Sogdiana
	4. 1st century CE: first evidence of the stirrup
	5. ca. 400 CE: Buddhist pilgrim Faxian travels Silk Road
* indian ocean trade
	1. 1st century: CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea; Indonesian migration to Madagascar
* saharan trade
	1. 500 BCE - ca. 1000 CE: Bantu migrations
	2. 200 BCE: Camel nomads in southern Sahara
	3. 46 BCE: first mention of camels in northern sahara
	4. ca. 300: beginning of camel nomadism in northern sahara

# [[silk-road]]
* connected China to Central Asia, and the Middle East to Central Asia
* fostered the exchange of agricultural goods, manufactured products, and ideas
* although customers were mainly wealthy elites, the silk road still affected entire societies
	* new products, processes, ideas, and customs were still brought into society by traders 
* speakers of both Turkic languages and Iranian tongues became connected

> **trading demand factors**
> - chinese eagerness for western products--especially horses
> - western eagerness regarding the Parthian state--due to Parthian's markets and relations with Indian markets

### - iranians and chinese
* the Parthians was leaded by a nomadic Iranian
	* they established their own kingdom in northeastern Iran
	* they originated east of the Caspian Sea
	* they became a major force by 247 BCE
	* they also helped foster the Silk Road due to close proximity and sharing customs with other nomads
* General Zhang Jian from China made journeys across Central Asia
	* he encountered westward-flowing rivers for the first time at the fertile [[#- ferghana valley|Ferghana Valley]]
	* he brought new plants and trees to China 
		* specifically, alfalfa--best fodder for horses
* Chinese farmers gained new crops, while artisans had new products for tanning, dyeing, making ink, and medicine 

### - ferghana valley
* this is a rich, agricultural, and industrial valley divided between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan
* the Syr Darya river drains this valley, while providing water for cotton cultivation
* the population + neighbors included lots of [[#nomads]]

### - nomads
* these were the people who had herds of animals to follow
* they lived in round portable dwellings
	* these were sometimes carried on wagons
* their migration had little to do with trade but...
	* they provided pack animals and protection
	* controlled transit across their land
* depended on bronze/iron from settlers
	* used in bridles, stirrups, cart fittings, and weapons
* nomads lived in *yurts*--portable felt huts (aka *gers* in Mongolia)
	* these houses had wall paintings
	* expressed Chinese silks + Iranian brocades
	* + richly outfitted horses
	* + interest in Buddhism

### - the stirrup
* an invention from the [[silk-road#the mongols|Kushan]] people
* the design evolution...
	* solid bar -> leather loop -> leather device + metal/wood support
	* supported rider's toe + ball of the foot
	* more support = more mount stability = better warriors

# indian ocean maritime system
* established by multilingual, multiethnic society of seafarars
* a trade network across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea
* left few records but...
	* forged strong economic and social ties between the coastal lands of East Africa, southern Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, Southeast Asia, and southern China 

> **distinct regions + main traders**
> 1. South China Sea -> Chinese, Malays and Indonesians
> 2. East cost of India to the islands of Southeast Asia -> Indians and Malays
> 3. West Coast of India to the Persian Gulf and the East Coast of Africa -> Persian and Arabs

### - sailors' tales
* Greek writers are making stories about voyages into the Indian Ocean
	* most storied featured Phoenicians
	* these were the most fearless of Mediterranean seafarers
* The story of Hippalus resembles the story of General Zhang Jian

### - ship design
* Indian Ocean ships != Western, Mediterranean ships

| Indian Ocean                   | Mediterranean                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Triangular Sails               | Square sails                         |
| No oars                        | Long banks of oars                   |
| Planks tied + caulked together | Planks nailed                        |
| Ventured long reaches          | Rarely ventured out of sight of land |

### - origins of contact and trade
* there were migrations from Southeast Asia to Madagascar
	* people from Indonesian islands established themselves here
	* their route likely touched coasts of India + Southern Arabia for supplies 
	* settlers farmed and made relations with Africans who came across the Mozambique Channel--a body of water separating Madagascar from Africa ~400-500 CE
	* seafarers had descendants here and preserved homeland language + culture
	* this preserved culture spread to mainland africa--although it eventually faded

### - goods
* africa -> exotic animals, wood, ivory
* arabia + somalia -> frankinsence + myrrh
* persian gulf -> pearls
* oman -> copper mines
* india -> spices + manufactured goods
* there was early contact with other islands in 2000 BCE too

### - impact
* product demand -> inspired mariners -> long ocean voyages
* small groups of seafarers had >social impact despite lack of political power
* women didn't go on voyages, so they were married in port cities
	* this made bilingual + bicultural families
	* women raised children to be more [[#vocab|cosmopolitan]]
	* women introduced men to more customs/attitudes
	* thus seafarers had rich cultural diversity

# sahara routes
* the sahara is a desert from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and is broken up by the Nile river
* it isolates sub-Saharan africa from the Mediterranean world
* the dryness dates back to ~2500 BCE--before was a 25 century period of drying-out
* by 300 BCE lakc of water restricted traveling to difficult routes
* these routes were initially only known to desert nomads

### - rock paintings
* hunters left images of animals--which date back to a long time ago, before they became extinct and when it was wetter
* the art shows hunting societies got new culture 
	* they bred cattle--which likely originated from else where
	* they adapted to the reduced grapzing
	* then horse herders succeeded the cattle herders
	* horses would draw chariots
		* theory: these charioteers established societies in the remaining grassy areas in the Sahara--but no evidence

### - the camel
* saharan trade likely relates to the spread of camel domestication
	* this idea is supported by rock art
* first mention in North Africa is from latin text of 46 BCE
* native camels likely died before domestication, these other ones likely came from Arabia
* camel herding made it easier for people to roam the desert  

### - trade 
* 2 diff trading systems had to be linked--one north, another south
* southern traders -> supplied salt to sub-Saharan Africa
* traders from equatorial forest zone -> brought forest products to trading centers near desert's southern fringe
* there were also the farming people of the Sahel
	* they lived in the southern borderlands of the Sahara--in arabic "Sahel" literally means "coastland"
	* there were middlemen from here who played a role in trade, although details are lacking
	* other traders still got products from Sahel too
* north, roman colonists -> supplied italy with agricultural products

### - sub-Saharan Africa
* the area south of the sahara
* initially had lack of external contact
* from 300 BCE - 1100 CE, folk migration led to cultural exchange
* geographic obstacles impeded access to sub-Saharan Africa (bodies of water, desert)
* environments completely change
	* [[#vocab|steppes]] in Sahel -> savanna -> tropical rain forest in Niger -> steppe -> desert --> highlands (NORTH-SOUTH TRAVEL)
* cultural unity of the entire region was brought by [[#vocab|small traditions]]
	* this developed due to long isolation + migration + social interaction
* this region covered a larger + more diverse area than any other cultural region in the first 1000 CE + had a lower overall population density
	* societies had room to grow, but lack of contact for rigid uniformity

### - characteristics
* despite cattle, no plows--just hoe and digging stick for cultivation
* music was a whole character--so many instruments were played by Africans
* kingdoms varied but there was a common ritual isolation of the king
* there were fixed social categories--age groupings, kinship divisons, distinct gender roles and relations, and occupational groupings
	* although not hierarchical, this structure had a similar role to noble -> commoner -> slave

### - migration 
* the common characteristics likely came from people who once occupied the southern Sahara
	* in paleolithic times periods were dryness -> wetness -> ...
	* wetness eventually increased, brought a storm belt, and forced the southern Sahara population to migrate southward
	* these migrators concentrated in the Sahel
	* there was likely migration away from dryness too, settling easy near the Nile valley

### - iron and the bantu 
* agriculture was common between the equator and the Sahara by ~2000 BCE
	* this displaced hunting and gathering as it spread southward
* then copper mining appeared in the Sahara ~1000 BCE
* iron was smelting in the northern sub-Saharan Africa ~1000 CE and spreading southward
* africans likely discovered how to smelt iron on their own
* more than 300 languages spoken south of the equator belong to the Bantu, a branch of the Niger-Congo family--"bantu" means "people" in most languages
* the spread of bantu languages relates to a divergence
	* proto-bantu--the original speakers--engaged in fishing and lived in permanent villages with crops and domesticated animals
	* their homes were near early iron smelting sites
	* they likely migrated and spread iron with them
	* they would have iron tools that could establish societies with more denser populations than earlier

# the spread of ideas
* customs spread along trade routes 

### - domestic pigs
* southeast asia was an early center of pig domestication
* eating pork was ritualized / only for ceremonies
* in ancient Egypt--the other side of the indian ocean--pigs were associated with an evil god and prohibited from being eaten
	* this prohibition is followed by the Israelites and Muslims
* an Iranian religion associated the boar with an important god

### - ashoka and kanishka
* King Ashoka, Mauryan ruler of India
* Kanishka, king of the [[silk-road#the mongols|Kushans]]
* both promoted buddhism ~ 300 BCE - 200 CE
* missionaries and others crisscrossed India / Silk Road / Indian Ocean, and brought buddhism else where
* Faxian, a Chinese pilgrim, traveled buddhist site to buddhist site
	* he lived at Sri Lanka for 2 years--its a buddhist land
* overall, these teachings of buddha still preserved/adapted in different ways
	* Theravada -> centered in Sri Lanka, close to buddha's earliest teachings
	* Mahayana -> centered in East Asia, stressed attaining nirvana but choosing to remain human to help others

### - spread of christianity
* had early spread in Asia + Africa 
* Armenia--situated in modern Turkey--served as a battleground
	* Iranian states to the south
	* Mediterranean states to the west
	* both wanted control due of Armenia due to silk road proximity
	* eventually Christianity spread
* Ethiopia was similar-- Iran v. Christians
	* [[#vocab|missionaries]] were sent to seek converts
	* Frumentius--taken captive, became treasurer and then leader of Ethiopia
	* he helped Roman Christians establish Christian communities here
	* Christianity then spread from Ethiopia to Nubia--south of egypt

### - stele of aksum 
* 70-foot / 21-meter stone
* tallest remnant of a field of steles--referring to standing stones
* imitates Aksumite architecture

# vocab
* cosmopolitan - to describe someone who is familiar/at ease w/ different cultures + countries
* steppes - ecological regions of grass/shrub covered plains--this is too treeless + arid for agriculture
* savanna - an area of grassland with scattered trees and bushes
* tropical rain forest - an jungle/forest with a lot of rain + low change in temp + high organism diversity 
* great traditions - complex beliefs over a broad area--this may include written language, legal/belief systems, ethical codes
* small traditions - localized set of customs adhered to by a single society
* missionaries - people who spread their religious beliefs to others

# conclusion
> - the commonality of Africa was not attributed to the other networks in the Sahara, Indian Ocean, nor Silk Road
> - transportable goods, new ideas, new technologies, livestock, and agricultural products changed people lives--and they were facilitated by these trade systems
> - the lifestyle of nomads, traders, seafarers was quite isolated--reluctance to share knowledge with potential competitors increased this
> - yet, the bantu went against this, and supposedly spread the iron implemented lifestyle and new techniques with intent
> - the trade systems brought diversity through new products and ideas; the bantu brought a degree of cultural dominance
> - ideas and religion spread was far more impacted by trade systems however--"great traditions" linked believers over distances, and merged with "small traditions" to meet their needs
